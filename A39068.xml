            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe firſt thing to be conſidered in Breeding is the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Ground, wherein the Horſes, Mares and Colts are to run, which muſt in no wiſe be too rank of Graſs, nor over ſparing, but a firm, ſweet Soil, ſituate in a wholſome Air, ſomewhat aſcending; incloſed with Quickſets and ſpreading Trees, the better to ſhelter your Beaſts from the wind or heat of the Sun: Nor let your Mares, Colts or Horſes continue long in one Paſture, but put them into freſh Paſture, and let the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude be ſo often as occaſion requires, or as you find them uneaſie, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ether by their careleſneſs in feeding, attempting to leap the Hedges, Ditches, or making continually towards the Gate,

               <head>Directions and Rules about the choice of Horſes.</head>
               <p>THe next thing to be conſidered, is the choice of Stallions and Mares; Firſt, let your Stallion have hoofs hard and ſound, round and hollow, to keep the feet from the Ground, his Legs even and ſtraight, his knees round, flexible and ſmall, his Thighs large and well brawned, his Breaſt great and broad, his neck ſoft and broad bending Arch-wiſe, his Main thick, and for the moſt part falling on the right ſide, his Head ſmall and lean, for a great head betokens a dull and heavy Jade, his Mouth ever moiſt, his Eyes great and bloody, or rather fiery, ſtanding as it were, out of his head, which is a ſign of quickneſs and livelineſs, his Ears ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:58037:16"/> and ſtanding upright, his Noſtrils wide, his Shoulders large and ſtraight, the ſides turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwards, the ridge bone over the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being ſomewhat high, his Sides deep and well knit behind, his Loyns broad, his Belly gaunt, his Buttocks full of fleſh, his Tail long, briſly and curled: theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tokens of a good Stallion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of a good Horſe for all ſervices; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary properties denoting badneſs: And now I ſhall proceed to the deſcription of a good Mare for breeding; firſt, obſerve ſhe be not ſubject to diſeaſes, nor above three or four years old, let her have a fair forehead, lively eyes, ſtanding ears, a large womb, a bright colour, and well metled, gentle and eaſie to be handled, for wild Mares are too apt to deſtroy their Colts in their bellies, and when foaled will not eaſily brook the weaning of them.</p>

               <p>IF your Mare be backward to take the Horſe, which will appear by her bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and kicking at him, then turn to her a ſtone Horſe of ſmall ſtature, who by his nimble running about her and playing with her, will ſoon wooe, or oblige her to gentleneſs, ſo that ſhe will ſuffer her ſelf to be covered, which willingneſs perceived, take away the ſaid Horſe, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about Sunriſing, put to her your Stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having been well provendered, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to drink little, put him to her in a cloſe fenced ground, where ſhe will in a ſhort time permit him to cover her, the which when he has twice or thrice done, let her graze, but keep her from water; taking the Horſe from her, whom you muſt rub down and well provender till E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, at what time turn him looſe to your Mare again, and let him cover her as often

               <p>The Mare thus covered, unleſs ſhe be greatly deſirous of his company a third time, you need not put him to her again, but lead the Mare into the water above the belly, and there let her drink, though no great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, after which turn her to the Stud of Mares, not permitting any Horſe to come at her for the ſpace of one month.</p>

               <p>IF you conceit your Mare or Mares have not conceived by their being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and yet decline taking Horſe, put among them a Mare that is deſirous to be covered, and then turn in your Stallion, who by covering the Mare laſt put in, will provoke the others to ſuffer themſelves to be covered. The moſt convenient time to ſuffer your Mares to be covered, is in <hi>May,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> for then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58037:18"/> the Colts by not coming too early in the Spring, will find warm weather, and green Paſture to nouriſh and preſerve them. When you intend your Stallion ſhall cover your Mare; the beſt way is to let him feed on Graſs, for by that means his Limbs will be more pliable, and his Wind the longer; when as hard meat will not only make him ſomewhat Reſtif, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him if he much over-ſtrain himſelf, to break his wind When your Mare is fourteen or fifteen days gone with Foal, take her up from the other Mares; and with one gentle Mare or Gelding put her into rank and well incloſed Paſture, which will render her luſty, deſirous again to be covered, the more eaſily to bring forth her Colt, and ſtore her with milk for its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>

               <p>A Good Stallion proportioned according to the aforeſaid deſcription, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately uſed, will ſerve well ſix or ſeven years, to cover yearly ſix or ſeven Mares; and may in the intervall be put to ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

From three years old till ten, good Mares will conceive Colts; and a good Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, from four or five, till ten or twelve, get them. The beſt time to wean Colts is <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> or <hi>Candlemaſs;</hi> and for the three firſt years, have great care of them, but eſpecially the firſt year, when they take no great delight in themſelves, for moaning after their Dams; and if you neglect the years aforeſaid, to well Winter or Summer them, they will ſcarcely prove good Horſes: the beſt way to order them, is to keep them out of the Neighing of their Dams, pinned up fourteen days after their weaning: after which days let them out on Sunſhiny days to play in little Pingles, or warm incloſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, putting them up again ſo ſoon as you perceive them dull and heavy; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them with good feeding till <hi>May;</hi> then the weather being warm, let them run in good Paſture, neither too rank nor too low; but ſuch as Milch Kine are uſually Paſtured in, but be ſure it be into ſoil that produceth ſweet Graſs, and in this manner continue them, till they have forgotten their Dams.</p>

               <head>Provender moſt convenient for Colts after two years old, till they become fit for ſervice. The reaſons why Engliſh breed ought not to be taken up ſo young, though more convenient for their Maſters. How to handle and break wild and headſtrong Horſes, and to uſe them after they are made Gentle. The beſt feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the winter for Mares and Colts of two years old, and what age is beſt to handle them.</head>
               <p>BE ſure to obſerve that your weanlings of the age aforeſaid be not put to winter in cold wet Mooriſh ground, nor in Summer to feed in over rank Paſture; for the one ſubjects them to all watery diſeaſes, and the other to the Glanders, Colds, and the like. Therefore let your Colts range in dry, ſhort and warm paſtures, that they may find enough to ſuffice them, and too much. And leſt their growth be obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by covering any Mare, keep them from ſo doing, till they are five years old at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Many are of opinion that Engliſh Horſes are taken up ſo young, becauſe, that if they ſhould come to their full ſtrength ere they are broken, they would hardly be tamed,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58037:19"/> though this does altogether prove a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar error: for by often uſing young Horſes to ſeed them by hand, will make them tame, at any year, and to lay light weights upon them, which will in no wiſe hinder their growth, will prepare them to indure backing: Therefore it is my opinion that Engliſh Horſes may be broken and brought to hand, at any time, as well as thoſe of other Nations: And that the taking them up before they come to their ſtrength and growth, is for that their Maſters are covetous of their ſervice, and will not permit them to be idle and chargeable any longer than needs muſt; and this is the reaſon why Engliſh Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fall ſhort many times in goodneſs, or at leaſt in eſteem, to thoſe of other Nations. For certain it is, that <hi>England</hi> is as capable of as good a breed as any Nation whatſoever; and that by watching and keeping a Horſe hungry, he at any age may be made tame or broken in a months time.</p>
               <p>If a Horſe be headſtrong, ſuffer him to have no provender, but what he takes out of your hands, in a ſtable or cloſe yard, and ſo within a while he will come acquainted with you, and ſuffer you to take up his feet, and by degrees to back and handle him at pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58037:20"/>
               <p>Obſerve that when you have rid your Horſe, keep him upon his Bridle, or gently moving till he be cold, and in no wiſe ride him hard upon a full ſtomach, and it will preſerve him from Sickneſs, Lameneſs and the like, unleſs ſome extraordinary thing befall him.</p>
               <p>In winter time keep your Mares and weanling in a warm paſture, where a Rack being placed, you muſt put thereinto, at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, ſweet Provender; and if it prove wet, miſty, raw weather, they muſt be ſheltred in a Stable, Barn or Hovel, but if clear Froſty weather, not too extream, they may be left abroad. Let your paſture be near your houſe, and about <hi>Shrovetide</hi> ſhift it, and let them continue in freſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture till <hi>May,</hi> at which time the Graſs will be ſufficiently ſprung in moſt places, and that time is the only time in all the year to produce hunger bane, and render the young Mares ſo lean that they will not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bringing forth their Colts.</p>
               <p>Take not up your Colts till they be four or five years old; for if ſooner, they will greatly ſuffer, by untimely riding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtiff, diſeaſed, and unſerviceable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be twelve years old, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will continue ſerviceable twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four or twenty five years: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58037:20"/> why the Spaniſh Horſes are ſo ſoon paſt their beſt, is for that they at two or three years old at the moſt, take them up for want of ground to feed them in.</p>

               <p>The ſhin-bone being long and large from the Paſtern to the knee, denotes the Colt to prove a tall Horſe. And what ſpace is found in a Colt new foaled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Withers and knee, double that ſpace will appear when he is full grown.

               <p>If a Mare be diſtreſſed in her foaling, the ready way to make her bring forth, is to ſtop both her Noſtrils with your hand,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58037:21"/> that ſo ſhe may be the better obliged to ſtrain her ſelf, or if that fail, take Madder to the quantity of a Pigeons Egg, boil it in a pint of ALE, and give it her warm.</p>
               <p>If her Secundine, after foaling, come not away, take a handfull or two of young fennel, boil it in running-water, or ſpring-water if you can get it, half a pint of which mix with as much Malmſie, and a fourth quantity of Olive Oyle, and put it blood warm into the Noſtrils of your Mare, and hold them cloſe, or in defect of this, give her green Wheat or Rye to eat, but the former medicine is beſt, and will anſwer the end for which it was given. Obſerve that your Mare in no wiſe eat her Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for it is not only unwholſome, but a great obſtructer of her producing milk.</p>
               <p>When a Colt is weaned, put him out of the hearing of his Dam as aforeſaid, and the ſooner to make him forget her, give him Savin and Butter, which will effect it. Put him not to hard paſture, till the ſecond or third year after his weaning.</p>
               <p>Separate your Mare and Stone Colts at a year at furtheſt, for the Stone Colts being high fed and of much mettal, will attempt to cover the Mare Colts at the end of a year, which if permitted, proves the ſpoiling of them both. Nor is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58037:21"/> but altogether convenient, to ſeparate each years breed by putting them into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſtures.</p>
               <p>To geld Stone-Colts, the convenienteſt time is (and with the leaſt danger) at nine days old, if the Stones come down; if not let ſome days more paſs ere you attempt it: In this caſe, the time of the Moon and the ſigns are to be obſerved: The beſt time is when the Moon is in the Wain, and the ſign in <hi>Virgo,</hi> or <hi>Aries.</hi> And the beſt time in the year is the Spring and Fall: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe are the ſafeſt and convenienteſt times, yet this work may be done by a skillful hand at any time, as well on full grown Horſes as young Colts. And thus much I have thought fit to lay down for the inſtruction of the Breeder, which is the chiefeſt Office relating to a Horſe; for if he be ſpoiled in the breeding, all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, coſt and care beſtowed upon him will prove fruitleſs, for he will never be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Horſe.</p>

            <p>A Horſe of never ſo good a breed, and carefully brought up to the Saddle, falling into the hands of an unskillful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager, is like an unſtrung inſtrument, or a Ship without a Rudder.

               <p>YOur Horſe taken up, and with feeding by hand and handling made ſomewhat familiar, hang the Saddle and Bridle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near him, and often offer to put them on, till at laſt he will ſuffer you to do it; then girt him about, though not too hard, but rather put ſmall wiſps of Hay between his body and the girths for his eaſe, and let your Bridle be as eaſie as may be, though ſtrong and well put on to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his headſtrongneſs if he attempt it. Then in a fair day carry him abroad into a plain field or other convenient place, and make him trot round you, ſometimes che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing him with your voice, and at other times ſtriking him with your ſwitch as you ſee occaſion. Hang with your weight upon the Saddle, ſhake the Stirrups, ſtrike them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſides, and ſtrain the Crupper, with all ſuch matters as will happen in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, till he is familiar and ſeems well to brook them.</p>

               <p>Your Horſe by this means being plya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Saddle, take off the ſlight, looſe and eaſie Bridle. Gird the Saddle hard; then waſhing his mouth with ALE, you ſhall put into it a full mouth'd Trench, formerly uſed, and drawing the Reins o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head, lay them upon the Saddle, drawing them now and then, that he may have a feeling of the Trench, which will induce him to Champ, and play with the ſame, and thereby make him more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with it; after which having your Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in a readineſs, faſten it from the Chaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the Girths, but with ſome ſlackneſs, unleſs your Horſe is apt to toſs up his head upon ſtarting wantonneſs, or a col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOur Horſe throughly tamed and learned to advance, ſtop and turn without any ſeeming unwillingneſs; then riding him to ſome ſandy or gravelly place, where the print of his footſteps may plainly be ſeen, incircle the ground by trotting for the ſpace of 50 paces in compaſs, which done three or four times, reſt on the right hand and cheriſh your Horſe; then by moving him upon the Ring of the Circle, ſtop him upon the left hand, and let him reſt, ſtill incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging him, and by often changing your hand and mending your pace, you will ſoon make him perfect, but upon every full ſtop make him retire a pace or two in the ſame manner, if you can, as when he trots forward.</p>
               <p>Thus doing, your Horſe will be ready upon all turns, and with little labour brought to underſtand your meaning in moſt things, and eſpecially to gallop the Ring by degrees till he is capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it at full ſpeed: Obſerve in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Ring upon the gallop, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Horſe when he leads to the

Which ſome Horſes not doing, it had bred an opinion in Jockies and others, that it is not convenient to gallop the Ring; and their reaſon is for that by raiſing up his forefeet he gallops painfully; which is not, but when he carries them even: for if he ſet one before the other as aforeſaid, it is eaſily performed, and if the Horſe at firſt or ſecond time do not obſerve it, yet in the end, for his own eaſe, he will practiſe it, and having practiſed it, continue it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>TO make your Horſe retire, you muſt with a ſteddy Rein draw him back, ſo that with his legs lifted up as when he Trotteth forward, he muſt retreat three or four paces, which in a War-horſe is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary neceſſary, and indeed commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all Horſes brought up to the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but you muſt obſerve to make him do it in a direct line, not turning to one ſide or the other, nor ſuffer him to ſhuffle in his retiring, but take his legs clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ground.</p>

Theſe are the material leſſons at firſt to be learnt, which being perfected, are an Introduction to what remains, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it leſs difficult.</p>

               <head>Turnings and ſtrait Turns, what they are. And Rules to mannage your Horſe in that affair.</head>
               <p>THe turnings are, when the face of the Horſe is kept fixed on the Center or poſt, bearing about in circumference with his hinder parts, oppoſing his face to the face of his enemy.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58037:27"/>
               <p>The ſtrait turns are when your Horſe moving, keepeth his poſteriors inwards, and cloſe to the Center or poſt, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about makes the circumference, with his fore part advancing a little towards the enemy, that would avoid him.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtrait turn is to be mannaged thus, to the Ring in the middle of your Cavezan faſten a rein, about three yards or ſomewhat more in length, and to the other two Rings two reins, ſomewhat ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Then his bit and Saddle put on, bring him to the poſt, and there put the reins and bit over the Saddle-bolſter and all, and ſo faſten them at ſuch ſtraitneſs to the Pummel, that he may feel them both. Then if you are deſirous he ſhould turn to the right, take the ſhort rein on the left ſide of the Cavezan, and bringing it under the Saddles fore-bolſter, up to the Pummel, fix it there, at ſuch a ſtraitneſs, that his head may be rather ſwayed from, than to the poſt, his eyes looking to the right, at what time let ſome one of your attendants hold the rein on the right ſide of the Cavezan at the poſt, moving it ſo that the fore-part of your Horſes body may turn about at full. Then in your own hand take the long rein, cauſing him to bear his hinder-parts inwards, which you muſt do by ſtriking him gently
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58037:27"/> on the outward ſhoulder, and outward buttock, as you ſee occaſion, cauſing him to turn about the poſt; his hinder parts being the Center, whilſt his fore-parts move the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference: and thus uſe him on the one hand, till he is indifferent perfect; then by changing the rein on the other outward ring of the Cavezan, cauſe him to do it on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, after the ſame manner. And ſo you muſt exerciſe him morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till by a touch of your rod he couch his poſteriors to the Poſt, and ſwiftly Trot round, ſtill in his motion, placing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fore leg over the inward, and ſo by degrees in his wheeling oblige him to mend his pace, ſwiftly, and diſtinctly, and in as direct a compaſs as can eaſily or convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be performed; till at laſt he fly with ſuch Celerity that his fore and hinder-legs move equal.</p>
               <p>Your Horſe having learned this leſſon perfectly, mount his back, whilſt your Groom holds the long rein, and another the ſhort one, then with the motion of your hand upon the left rein of the Cavezan and bit, bearing his head from the poſt, and by the motion of the Calves of your legs, and your ſwitch upon his outward thigh, cauſing him to bear his hinder parts to the Poſt; exerciſe him till he performs it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58037:28"/> as well with you upon his back, as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then taking away the Cavezan, exerciſe him with the ſhort rein only, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees having brought him to be perfect at the Poſt, you may exerciſe him without a Poſt in any open place, and this motion will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for all the following ones.</p>
               <p>The ſtraight turn is to keep his face to the Poſt, as if he were facing his enemy, ſwiftly flying about with his hinder parts: His head being the Center; the reins both long and ſhort, muſt be uſed as before, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you muſt not give the ſhort rein ſuch ſcope, but drawing it nearer to the poſt; ſtill as he moves about, follow his hinder parts with the long rein, and obſerve whether he bear his hinder legs in his motion one over the other, as is expreſſed by his fore legs, with the help of your rod, making him bring his hinder parts ſwiftly round the Poſt, as is before ſaid; and when he is perfect, mount his back, and cauſe him with the foreſaid uſage to turn ſwift or ſlow, as you ſee occaſion: then leaving the Poſt, exerciſe him in an open place, till he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and expert in either turn, which will not only accompliſh him for the Wars, but for Hunting, Racing, and all other matters that can be required in a Horſe</p>

               <p>DIvers opinions, and divers ways are there to bring a Horſe to a true and graceful Amble, though indeed many or moſt of them fall ſhort, it being a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not learnt by any Horſe without great difficulty; to Trot and Gallop well and graceful, being far more eaſie: But howſoever I ſhall direct you what courſes to take, whereby it may the ſooneſt be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But before I give you my own opinion, I ſhall recite and confute the errors of thoſe, that have deceived themſelves and others, who have taken their meaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then divers are of opinion that the only way to bring a Horſe to a perfect Amble, is to trace him to and fro, in a new ploughed field, where the Mould is dry and ſoft; wherein they ſay he cannot with eaſe do any thing leſs than Amble: yet let me tell them, his Amble in ſuch a caſe, will be rather a ſhuffling, than a true Amble; beſides, it toils him ſo much that when he comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plain ground, remembring the ſlavery he was put to, he will rather fall into any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58037:29"/> other pace, and forever after be put out of love with Ambling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are ſome who hold it the beſt way to oblige a Horſe to fall from a gallop into an Amble, upon a ſuddain ſtop, made by checking with your bridle, and bearing forward, clapping the Calves of their Legs cloſe to his ſides: but this rule is altogether uncertain; beſides, by ſuch ſtops, they not only ſpoil their Horſes mouths, and ſo loſe the command of their rein upon divers occaſions, but indanger their Horſes; indammaging them by over ſtraining, ſpraining their ſinews, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hoofs, or the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some, again, are for ſetting on ſhoos of an extraordinary weight, which makes a Horſe interfere, and ſtrike ſhort; often indangering him with lameneſs, and for fear of ſtriking, ſo ſlow is his pace, that he can never by that means be brought to a graceful Amble. Others load their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Fetlock-paſterns, by wrapping Lead about them, which is more hurtful and dangerous than the former, often creating ſtrains, not curable, and by cruſhing or bruiſing the Crownet, cauſe Crown ſcabs, Ring-bones, Quitter-bones, and the like, to the utter diſabling of the Horſe. Others are of opinion that loading a Horſe with pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58037:29"/> weights croſs the Fillets, will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to Amble. But let me tell them, alſo and experience teach them, that if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſe that courſe, it will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſable any Horſe, by rendering him ſway-backed, and weak in the hinder parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Many give their opinion that there is no way like teaching a Horſe to Amble by hand after this manner: bring him, ſay they, to the ſide of a ſtraight wall, Pail, or Rail, and having moved him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a walking pace till he begins to be warm; then with your bridle-hand, you being on foot chock him, and at the ſame time with your rod fitly ſtrike him on the hinder Houghs, and under his belly when he treads falſe, cauſing him to pace by degrees: But this Rule is uncertain, for it rather hares and frights the Horſe, than any ways makes him underſtand what he is to do, obliging him to flounce, fly back, ſpraul, and rear himſelf on end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which often uſed he will retain, and ever after, upon the leaſt occaſion, ſtart and fly out, or very hardly be induced to leave them, or ſhould he by this means be brought to any perfection in Ambling; yet when you are mounted on his back he will be far to ſeek, and not underſtand your
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58037:30"/> motions, ſo that it will prove but time ſpent in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Many there are that hold a Horſe may be brought to Amble, by having ſhoos clapped on his hinder feet, with long plates before the toes, by which means at every ſtep the hinder foot may reach the fore foot; but this is not only incommodious, but dangerous: for in the firſt place the Horſe muſt go ſhuffling, and can be put into no true Amble; in the next place, if he ſtrike hard, he will cut, bruiſe or ſtrain the ſinews on the back of the forefoot, ſtill beating the forelegs forward; which frequently cauſes halting and lameneſs not curable, there being no part about a Horſe more tender.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Fine Liſts, ſome hold beſt to Amble, which in this manner they propoſe; take ſay they, a fine Liſt, twiſt it in the nature of a Cord, and drawing it ſtrait about your Horſes Cambrel, where Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers are wont to garter them for a ſtiff ſtrain, turn him to Graſs, which cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his ſinews will for his eaſe make him know no other pace but the Amble; and perfect him in it, in a fortnight or three-weeks. This is altogether uncertain, for the Horſe finding himſelf cramped, will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw his legs after him, and ſhuffle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58037:30"/> he be forced, and if the liſts are drawn too ſtrait, when they are taken off, the ſinews will be ſo numbed that he will be only capable of crambling and cringing; and moreover it will greatly ſubject him to the ſtring-halt, and often twitching up his legs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> There ſtill remain ſome that ſay there is no way like uſing your Horſe to the Tramel, to oblige him to Amble, which indeed is the beſt method; yet ſince there are many errors and over-ſights in it, I ſhall not think it amiſs to lay them down in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and then proceed to give ſuch rules as I conceive, and experience has proved, the beſt and readieſt way, to bring your Horſe to an eaſie, comely and graceful Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The firſt error is their not obſerving the fit and juſt length of the Tramel; for if it be too long and not capable of giving a ſtroke or too ſhort, and by that means gives a falſe ſtroke.</p>
               <p>The former makes the Horſe move ſhuffling and after a confuſed manner, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improper and indecent; &amp; the latter by the ſuddain twitches it obliges the Horſe to make, ſubjects him to the ſtring-halt, and other indecent motions of his feet.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58037:31"/>
               <p>The Second error is in thoſe who without a due proportion of their Tramel, will place it out of order, <hi>viz.</hi> faſten it above the knee of the foreleg, and about the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock of the hinderleg; when if it be too long, the foreleg cannot command the hinder to follow; and if it be too ſhort and ſtrait, ſo that the ſinews and Ligaments are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and girded, and that the foreleg and hinder muſt of neceſſity have equal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then will the main ſinews be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in the hinder leg, as alſo the veins and Ligaments of the fore thighs, to the utter diſabling of your Horſe for a time, if not for ever: nor can he then move, but in a cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſhuffling and halting poſture, altogether undecent and unprofitable; beſides, it will by long chafing bring down the humours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third Error, relating to the uſe of the Tramel, is when they that uſe it, make it of ſuch courſe hard ſtuff that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by girding it too ſtrait, or leaving it too looſe, it will either ſo gird or gall, that both skin and hair will be taken off, and ſo the Tramel rendred inſufferable, and not anſwer the expectation of him that put it on.</p>
               <p>The Fourth and laſt Error I ſhall expoſe to view, is the opinions of many, that the Tramel is altogether unneceſſary, alledging
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58037:31"/> Ploughed land moſt feezable, which is more an error in thoſe that aſſert it, than the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel is uſeleſs or erroneous; for the Tramel in my opinion rightly applyed, is the only means to bring your Horſe to a true Amble, the uſe of it being made as followeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The moſt approved and Experienced way to make a Horſe Amble true and compleat.</head>
               <p>WHen you deſign to teach your Horſe the true Amble, firſt by leading him a racking pace in your hand, obſerve to what motion he is moſt inclinable: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trot, Running, Baſtard-Amble or other, then mount him, and racking him delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, force him to advance by the help of his Mouth-Weeks, with his Snaffle, which muſt be full, ſmooth and large. Preſs him gently on both ſides with the Calves of your legs, and now and then a gentle touch with the Spur, if by that means you can oblige him to ſtrike into an Amble; but above all be ſure you do not by too much chafing, or too ſtrong a hand diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or force him to diſtort either his Mouth, Neck or Head; and if he do fall into an Amble, as it were of his own accord, though not perfect, yet; it is greatly promiſing that he will ſoon be induced to a pleaſant
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58037:32"/> Amble by the help of Art, and cauſe him with more patience and leſs danger to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Tramel, by reaſon the motion without ſtumbling, flying out, or the like, becomes natural. And now the next thing to be conſidered is the form of the true Tramel and its uſe, divers there are that make them of Leather, ſome of Canvas, and others of Liſts: but all of them are uncertain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious, by reaſon the firſt will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Horſe and the Rider by ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the ſecond diſable the Horſe by gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, and the third doth ſtretch and hang looſe, by reaſon of its ſoftneſs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt way, though many ways there are in uſe, beſides what I have mentioned, is to make your Tramel of ſtrong pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred, twiſted into a cord, about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Jack-line, hard and well dried, of which form your Tramel thus: let your ſide cords be ſo firm that they will not give the leaſt way; let the hoſe, or part faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about his legs be cloſe, ſoft and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the backbands light and ſomewhat broad, the better to avoid hurting your Horſes fillets, the length of the ſide Ropes muſt be juſt 36. inches; or if the Horſe be of a long reach, an inch may be added but no more, and ſo equal in length they muſt be, that the difference of a ſtraws breadth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58037:32"/> muſt not be perceived; the hoſe muſt be placed on the ſmall of the foreleg and upon the hinderleg, juſt above the fetlock, made of Girth-web, lined with Flannel, Cotton or ſome ſuch ſoft matter, faſtened with Neats-leather Tabs, made ſupple by tallowing, of an even length, in which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers holes muſt be punched at an even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to paſs through the nooſes which are to be on the ſide ropes, ſo that by buckling them with ſtrong buckles; the ſaid ropes may be drawn up or let out at pleaſure, the Tabs not to exceed 10 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor the holes in them four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>This done, let your back bands, whoſe uſe is to hold up the ſide Cords (if you Tramel all your Horſes legs) be made of Girth web, lined with Flannel or the like, to prevent galling; but if you Tramel but two of his legs, Filleting or ſtrong Tape will ſerve; but you muſt be careful that it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſide cords in an even line, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either twitching it up, or ſuffering it to fall, for theſe are groſs defects and great hindrances, for riſing ſhortens the ſide cord, and falling makes it apt to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the Horſe.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58037:33"/>
               <p>This being the manner of making the right Tramel: I ſhall now proceed to give my Reader a deſcription of its perfect uſe; as thus, bring your Horſe into an even place, not too hard or ſtony, and there putting on his hoſe on the near legs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind; faſten to them the ſide cords, as aforeſaid, the Horſe ſtanding as even as poſſible, not ſtraining forward nor crimpling inward, but to his juſt and due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; lay the ſide ropes faſtned by Girth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web or Tape to the Saddle, then laying your hand on the Bridle, oblige him by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head gently to move forward, or if you perceive it requiſite, let another aſſiſt you in forcing him forward, whiles you compel him to Amble about the ground, for that purpoſe choſen, as leiſurely as poſſibly, uſing him with all gentleneſs and often cheriſhing him with your voice, till he feel the Tramel, and begin to underſtand what he is to perform: And although he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or fall now and then, at his being brought to the Tramel, yet in a while he will grow perfect, if you be not too harſh towards him: But when he falls, rather cheriſh him, by permitting him to riſe at his leiſure, than ſeem harſh towards him; for by that means he will find out his own failings, and amend them, and ſoon underſtand the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58037:33"/> motion he is deſigned for; and in your hand Amble to your liking, though it is not amiſs if at firſt, when he begins to learn, that you permit the ſide ropes to be longer than the meaſure, before ſpecified, to prevent the ſuddain twiches, till he is uſed to the Tramel; but when he begins to be perfect, be ſure they be of a conſtant length, leſt the over length render him a ſlow Ambler, or the under length cauſe him to halt or ſhuffle.</p>

               <head>What time the Tramel may be altered and when it is moſt convenient to mount his back to jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YOur Horſe being brought perfectly to Amble by hand, you may change the half Tramel, removing it from one ſide, and placing it on the other, and as you ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion put on the whole Tramel, till he run ſwiftly without the motion of ſnappering or ſtumbling, after which try him upon uneven and uncertain ways, up &amp; down hill, over clumpers and falſe footing, that ſo he may in his Amble anſwer all Roads; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Horſes there are that will Amble ſmoothly and decently upon even ground, but when they happen upon rough and ſtony ways, fall into a hard trot ſhuffling
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58037:34"/> or an ill favoured pace, out of which it is very difficult to force them.</p>
               <p>The Horſe being thus tryed and no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty appearing, mount his back or ſet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do it, whilſt your ſelf by ſtaying his head, keep him from any ill conveniency, and take a narrow view how he treads his ſteps; after which, your ſelf mounting him and often cheriſhing him, may oblige him, to mend his pace, till he move with as much agility as you can deſire: yet forget not between whiles to put on ſometimes the half Tramel, and at other times the whole Tramel, often ſhifting them from one ſide to the other, leſt your Horſe ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his pace; and in ſo doing twice or thrice a day, you will bring him in a Month or ſix weeks to the heighth of perfection.</p>
               <p>Thus far having proceeded, you may without any Tramel ride him upon the road for three or four miles, not picking or chuſing your way, but taking the uneven with the even, and if you perceive him to baulk his Amble, then having the half Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel about you, put it on, which will ſoon put him in mind of what he is to perform; but if you perceive any impediment that cauſed him to forſake his Amble, remove it, and then try him again without the Tramel; for there is nothing belonging
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58037:34"/> to Horſemanſhip that is not requiſite to be uſed on this occaſion, or to be left off as occaſion requires, <hi>viz.</hi> the chain, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, Cavezan, Muſroul, Martingal, Bit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus much touching what relates to inſtruction for Ambling ſhall ſuffice, it not being in the leaſt to be queſtioned, but if theſe rules are obſerved, the Reader will have his deſire.</p>
               <p>As to Trotting and Galloping, they are paces ſo ordinary and ſo eaſie to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I need not much inlarge on them, as for the Trot, it is of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lofty or Prancing Trot, and the common or Running Trot. To oblige your Horſe to the firſt of theſe, you muſt perfect him at the Poſt, as is before recited; after which putting on a ſtrong Curb-Bit, by bearing him up, ſhortning your rein by twiſting it about your Bridle hand, oblige him to bend his neck Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not any ways inclining it to one ſide or the other, but foreright; and by uſing him to it, he will at length keep his head and neck in the ſame poſture when you ride him with a Snaffle, after which faſten a ſtrong ſtrap to his Girth under his belly, and bringing it between his forelegs, faſten it pretty ſtrait to the Curb, or Chain of the Bridle, and then mounting your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58037:35"/> Horſe, hold the reins with a ſteddy hand and cauſe your Horſe to move forward, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtriking him upon the hinder thighs with your rod, and at other times cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, at what time feeling his head ſtraitned, between the under and upper rein, he will lift his forefeet high, treading ſhort in a proud prancing manner, which by often uſage will make him perfect in it; when the under rein is taken away. As for the other Trot, the grace of it being when it is ſwift and ſmooth, the only way is at the firſt breaking of your Horſe, to ſet a full bodied man upon him, whoſe weight will ſo ballance him, that he cannot let his feet fall from ſuch a height, or with ſo ſtrong a ſpring to jolt the Rider, by reaſon he will not be capable of lifting them ſo high. Another way to oblige him to an eaſie Trot, is by loading him at his firſt bereaking with heavy ſhoos, which will make him Trot more deliberately, and with leſs ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his body, to offend his Rider.</p>
               <p>As for Galloping, it is divided into two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Hand-gallop, and Fullgal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, or Full-ſpeed, to either of which a skillful rider, by the mannagement of the rein, and uſe of Whip or Spur, may oblige a free Horſe at his pleaſure: Wherfore I ſhall no longer inſiſt on them, but conclude this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58037:35"/> part of Horſemanſhip, the moſt material of all others, and from it I ſhall proceed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the keeper what in his place is moſt convenient to be done, both for the credit of himſelf and the advantage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>

               <head>Rules to be well conſidered and exactly obſerved by all that undertake the care of good Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</head>
               <p>AMongſt other things appertaining to a Horſe, good looking to is not the leaſt, for if he fare never ſo well, if he be not carefully looked after, at all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſons, he will not thrive; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for their better underſtanding, to whom ſuch offices appertain, I ſhall lay down theſe following Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Riſing in Summer-time about Sun riſing, and in Winter-time by break of day, enter the Stable, having over-night prepared three pints or thereabouts of dry Oats well ſifted, and added to them a pint of ſplit Beans, give them your Horſe, the which when he has eaten, fall to dreſſing him, currying him over with your Iron Comb, leaving no part undone, then with your duſting cloth duſt him over, or for want of that with a Horſe tail, after which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58037:36"/> with your French bruſh beginning at his forehead, proceed by degrees to rub every part of him leaving not ſo much as the breadth of an inch untouched throughout him; then duſt him again, and with your wet hand lay and ſmooth his hair, then dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your hand, dry the wet places with the ſame, not forgetting to cleanſe his Sheath, Cods, Yard, Tuel, Forebowels, Ears, Noſtrils, and all other places that are ſubject, to ſweat or filth; this done, with your hair-cloth rub him over in all parts, but eſpecially his Head, Cheeks, Face and Eyes, the top of his forehead and between his chaps, then with a woollen Cloth kept clean for that purpoſe, rub him over again in all parts, and laſtly comb down his Main and Tail.</p>
               <p>The Horſe thus put into good order, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him and lead him out of the Stable, where mounting his back, ride him gently to water, but ſo that you may a little warm his ſtomach: then having permitted him to drink a conſiderable draught, Rack him gently ere you bring him into the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; having done that, though not made him ſweat, bring him into the Stable, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his cloaths ready; as ſoon as you have rubbed him down, put them on, and ſo let him ſtand for the ſpace of an hour, at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58037:36"/> which time give him two quarts of Beans and Oats mingled as aforeſaid, which being eaten, toſs into his Rack a hard knop of hay, and let him bite upon it till noon; noon being come, furniſh him with the like quantity of Beans and Oats and the like knop of Hay, if the former knop be eaten, or elſe not.</p>
               <p>Evening being come, carefully dreſs him, after the ſame manner as in the morning you did, and ſo ride him to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, warming him before you permit him, to drink, as likewiſe afterwards bring him into the Stable, clothing him and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him down without any alteration, and after an hours ſtanding give him Beans, Oats and Hay to the quantity aforeſaid; that is three pints of Oats one of ſpelt Beans, and a knop of Hay, and let him ſtand till Nine of the Clock at night, at what time renewing his Bait, and toſſing up his Litter, leave him till morning.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHen you intend to take a journey, ſee the day and night before, that your Horſe have his due proportion of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58037:37"/> meat, and be well rubbed down, clean Littered, and ſerved with warm water in the Stable without leading him abroad; and either with Trotters, oyl Neatsfoot-Oyl, or Dogs Greace, which it behoves you to have in a readineſs, ſupple the joynts of fore and hinderlegs, it being warmed over a fire, which will not only make him nimble in his Travail, but hold out much better than otherwiſe he would. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let him have his Beans and Oats, but no Hay. If you find him lively and met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſome, give him no water before you ride out, but being mounted ride him a mile or two, a racking pace, and when you find him well heated, ride him as you pleaſe, either Amble, Trot or Full-ſpeed, you cannot hurt him; but be ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when you come into your Inn, that you with your Glazing Knife ere you rub him down, take off the ſweat) the knife ſo called, is made of an old Sword blade or a piece of a Scithe) after which rub him down, and cleanſe him as you have been formerly ſhewed. Then he having eaten his allowance of meat, which muſt for conveniencies ſake be double what at once you are to give him when he ſtands idle; you muſt if you find him any thing hot, give him warm water, but if he be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58037:37"/> indifferent cool, cold water will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice him.</p>
               <p>Having after a journey, heat, or the like, brought home your Horſe, hot or tyred, bring him not into the Stable till he be pretty well dryed, and cooled by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate walking; when being entred the Stable, and tyed up to the Rack, rub him down as you have been ſhewed before, and girt his cloaths faſt about him: Tucking ſome drie wiſps between his body and the Girths, and when he has ſtood on the Bridle for the ſpace of two hours; toſs a knop of Hay into the Rack, whilſt you prepare your Oats and Beans to the quantity of two quarts, amongſt which it will not at all be amiſs, but rather profitable, if you mix half a pint of Hempſeed well cleanſed; and at night when he comes to receive his laſt bait, give him warm water mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſmall quantity of fine Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, and ſo toſſing up his Litter let him reſt till Morning.</p>
               <p>As to waſhing and walking your Horſe after a journey; I hold them both dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the former occaſioning ſurfeits, and the latter contagious colds turning into the Glanders, and other both troubleſome and noyſome infirmities. But if he be extraordinary dirty, take a pail of warm
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58037:38"/> water, and having firſt ſcraped off the dirt, rub him with a wet bruſh till he become clean. If he be hot and not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be Stabled, then ride him gently up and down, till you find him temperate and cool; but in no wiſe walk him in your hand, leſt the dullneſs of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſpiring with the cold diſeaſes damp his courage, and by that means ſubject him to divers infirmities. And thus much for our Keeper. Now I ſhall proceed to give inſtructions to the Feeder; though indeed the Keeper and the Feeder are in a manner one and the ſame: But ſince much remains in that nature, in order to prepare a Horſe for Racing, Hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall lay down Rules and Methods apart, ſuch as will not only (if rightly obſerved) ſave great charges, but more ſpeedily than what has yet been publickly known) fit and prepare Horſes for all Noble recreations.

               <head>Rules to be obſerved in preparing and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Horſe deſigned to Run, according to the condition he is in, and the temper of his body.</head>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58037:38"/>
               <p>THe chief thing, when you have match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Horſe, or are about to match him, that is requiſite to be obſerved, is the ſtate of his body; but eſpecially whether he be Foul, Fat, or newly taken from Soil, or Graſs; whether through exceſſive riding or other hard uſage, he be reduced to leanneſs or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with any infirmitie; or whether he is in a good and likely condition, through kindly uſage and gentle breathings: and according to theſe obſervations, proportion your time, in order to fit and prepare your Horſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your deſire. Two months being the longeſt time you need deſire, be he in the worſt of the conditions aforeſaid, if the following inſtructions be exactly obſerved, the worſt of which is his being Foul and Fat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reaſon the Greaſe muſt be brought away, before he can be fit, for this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exerciſe; ſix weeks, if he be lean, for then his feeding and exerciſe need not be diſtinct in days, but every day both of them put in practice, as for a Horſe in good caſe, and free from infirmity: I hold that a month is ſufficient, if he be carefully looked after to prepare him.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, the next is to obſerve whether your Horſe, if fat, by extraordinary exerciſe, is ſo tender that he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58037:39"/> loſes his fleſh and falls away; if ſo, you muſt be more moderate in your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and tender over him; but if you find him hardy, and of a free ſpirit, then you muſt keep him up to it, and he will prove the better. Again, if your lean Horſe be of a free temper, and feeding upon all meats, will get his fleſh up apace, and not loſe it by exerciſe; then you need not be ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over him, and the like muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by your Horſe in the middle ſtate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taking ſpecial notice of their Limbs; that there harbour no defect; for if ſo, your labour will be greatly hazzarded, if not altogether loſt.</p>
               <p>Having thus far proceeded, I ſhall now lay down Rules for dieting your Horſe, in preparing for your match, and by reaſon that all the three before mentioned may be ſaid to be contained in the fat Horſe; I ſhall firſt begin with him.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>The manner of the firſt fortnights diet for a Horſe that is fat and foul, or upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from ſoil or graſs, and what is neceſſary therein to be obſerved.</head>
               <p>YOur fat and foul Horſe, made ſo by either ſtanding at ſoil, or running at graſs, too high feeding or the like: If you have matched him, or intend ſo to do; when you have brought him into your Stable,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58037:39"/> to prepare him for the Race, riſing early the firſt fortnight, you muſt firſt of all, having rouſed him, if he be laid, waſh his Bridle in Beer or Ale, tie it to the rack; and cleanſe the Stable of the Horſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and then exceedingly well dreſs him. For the manner whereof, to avoid repetition, I refer you to be guided by thoſe Rules, I have laid down in the Office of the Keeper, in the Chapter of this book, unleſs what is neceſſary to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as being in this caſe neceſſary, though in the general way of dreſſing, not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly material, which principally relate to your Horſes cloathing. For by reaſon the Heats in preparing your Horſe for this exerciſe, muſt be more, and frequenter than upon any other occaſion: So therefore muſt the care be great, to prevent his catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold; falling into a ſurfeit or the like. When you have well dreſſed him in the morning, and cleanſed him from filth, leaving no part about him untouched, as aforeſaid, having a large body-cloth made of ſtrong warm Kerſie, if the weather be cold; or if hot, Cotten, or other light ſoft ſtuff will ſerve: Fold it about his body, and putting on his Saddle, let his foremoſt girth be girded cloſe, but the other looſe, thruſting in large ſoft wiſps of Straw near his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58037:40"/> heart, that ſo the ſlack girth may by the help of the wiſps be made ſtrait as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then put on a warm breaſt cloth, ſo that it may cover his ſhoulders. When having ſpirted about three or four ſponfulls of beer into his mouth; then leaving one to prepare the Stable againſt your return, lead him forth, and after a turn or two in your hand, mount his back, and rack him gently, for the ſpace of a mile or more, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plain and even ground, till you can, if poſſible, come to ſome ſteep Hill, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gradually, up which gallop him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and being come to the top, or ſo high as you think convenient; Rack or walk him down again, that, by that means he may cool as much in deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he heated in aſcending; and having after this manner pretty well exerciſed him, it being yet early in the morning, lead him or ride him a moderate pace to ſome pleaſant River, Spring or other ſweet run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water, and ſuffer him to drink as much as he pleaſes, but if he altogether refuſes to drink, then moderately exerciſe him; as aforeſaid, but if he refuſe to drink, warm him by riding gently, to provoke him to thirſt.</p>
               <p>When your Horſe has drank his fill, rack
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58037:40"/> him gently homewards, ſo that he may come into the Stable without a wet hair; the ſtable being freſh littered with Wheat-Straw (for Barly, or Rye Straw are both nought: the one cauſing heart burning and the other ſcowring) by whiſtling and ſtretching your Horſe upon the caſt out Litter, indeavour to make him void urine, the which if he at firſt decline to do, yet at laſt, by often uſage, he underſtanding what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, will do it freel, and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſerve the ſtable clean, and render it more healthy: this done and your Horſe entred the Stable, keeping his head in the bridle, tye it up to the Rack, then with hard wiſps, rub down his legs with all your ſtrength; then taking off his breſt-cloth, rub his head, neck and breaſt, with care and diligence, with a dry cloth, after which take off his Saddle, and hang it up, rubbing the place where it ſat, as likewiſe all the other parts of his body. His body cloth being taken off, and when you have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently rubbed him, leaving no place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, cloath him again, firſt by ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Linnen cloth over him, and girding it about him; upon that a warm houſing cloth, and over both the Woollen body-cloth, which in winter muſt be lined with Cotten, or ſome other warm ſtuff; but in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58037:41"/> Summer it matters not whether it be lined or no, for the Kerſie will then prove ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. This done wiſp him round with ſoft wiſps, though large, that ſo when he is diſpoſed to reſt, he may lie eaſie. From this proceed to pick his feet, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cleared them of the Gravel or dirt, ſtop them with Cowdung; and throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Rack a ſmall bottle of Hay, not exceeding three pound, and let it be well duſted, the which let him eat, and ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bridle for the ſpace of an hour and half; then cleaning the Manger of duſt and Hayſeeds, take about a quart of large white Oats, commonly known by the name of <hi>Poland</hi> Oats, or cut Oats, theſe above all others being the wholeſomeſt, the reſt ſome being unſweet breed infirmities, otherſome being moiſt breed Worms in the belly; new Oats occaſion ſwelling, and Black-Oats worſt of all cauſe ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and bad humours, thereby ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colouring the dung, that the ſtate of the Horſes body is not thereby to be known.</p>
               <p>The quantity of Oats aforeſaid, well dryed, put into a Riddle or Sieve, called a reeing ſieve, ſo big as it will permit the ſmall and light Oats to paſs through, and retain the large and ſolid ones; and by reeing them after they are throughly cleanſed, give
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58037:41"/> them your Horſe to eat in the Manger, it being made clean, as aforeſaid. If he eat them heartily, and ſeem deſirous of more, you may then give him another like quantity ſo ordered, and then permit him to ſtand or lie down at his pleaſure, till about Eleven of the Clock. At which time, coming to viſit him, rub down his Head, Neck, Face and Cheſt; and give him about three pints of Oats ordered as before; and then making the Stable as cloſe and dark as you can, leave him for the ſpace of two hours, for the cloſer the Stable is, and the darker the Horſe ſtands, the better will he take his reſt, and digeſt his food: Therefore many hang their Stalls round and over head with Canvas, or other thick cloaths. Nor is it amiſs, for it not only darkens the place, but prevents any noiſome thing from falling into their Provender, as Lime Spiders, duſt, and the like.</p>
               <p>The two hours ended, accoſt him again, with the like quantity of Oats as before; dreſt and prepared, after the ſame manner, rubbing over his Head, Face, Neck and Breaſt with a clean cloth; and if he hath dunged, carry it forth, and caſt up his Litter, which done, caſt a knop of Hay into his Rack, leave him for three hours more; if in Summer; but if in Winter two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58037:42"/> hours, or two and a half; at the expiration of which time, viſit him again, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him any meat, waſh his Bridle in Beer, and put it on; taking off his cloaths by degrees, and rubbing him all over in the manner as has been formerly ſhewed; then clapping on his Saddle, bring him forth, and endeavour to make him empty himſelf upon the old Litter; and ſo mount his back gently, Racking him for an hour, or thereabout, and then if poſſible give him his breathings, along the ſide of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant River; but do not gallop him up any hill, for that upon a full ſtomach, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his Wind; ſo that obſerve to let his evening breathings be in ſmooth ſolid ground as you can chuſe: and heat him both before and after water, as in the Morning, letting him ſmell to all the old or new Horſe dung you find in the way, which will not only provoke him to empty, but ſharpen his appetite, and ſo continuing him abroad till night approach, (for early and late Airings are the moſt proper to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the foulneſs, and diſperſe the groſs humours) bring him home, and having cauſed him to empty at the Stable door, draw his Bridle, cleanſe the Manger, and at all points dreſs him, and rub him down as in the morning, and then giving him a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58037:42"/> like quantity of Oats; let him ſtand upon his Bridle till about nine of the Clock, then viſit him again, when rubbing him down and toſſing up his Litter; give him another quart of Oats well ſifted, and a knop of Hay, and ſo let him remain till the next morning, at which time uſe him as you did the morning already ſpecified, and thus continue him without adding or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought for the firſt fortnight, which will put him into ſo good a temper that in the beginning of the ſecond fortnight, his foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being diſpelled, you may give him conſiderable heats without offence; but if you perceive his fatneſs and foulneſs, not to be waſted and gone, uſe him the more moderately, for the ſpace of four or five days longer.</p>

               <p>OBſerve that two heats in one week are as much as are convenient for any Horſe, of what ſtate or temper of body ſoever.</p>
               <p>That one of theſe heats be given him upon the day he is to run the match, is moſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58037:43"/> requiſite, as thus; if your match be to be performed upon a <hi>Tueſday,</hi> then let <hi>Tuſeday</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> in every week be your heating days, and obſerve that on <hi>Tuſeday,</hi> you give him the greateſt heat, for two reaſons; firſt becauſe 'tis the day whereon he is to run for the wager; and for that there are three whole days reſpite between, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion your day to this ſpace and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatever day the match is to be run, unleſs by reaſon of Rainy Slabby wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if it rains, you muſt defer to heat him till the Rain be over, and the weather clear up: and in this caſe, where you are to make a vertue of neceſſity, you may change the hours of your heats, as the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will permit.</p>
               <p>In dull dripping or damp weather, when you ride abroad, you muſt put your Horſe on a warm Linnen hood, with ears, and the nape of the neck thickned with a lining, to keep out the rain and cold damp; as likewiſe a cloth to keep the wet from falling upon the Fillets of your Horſe; for nothing will more ſubject him to infirmity than wet in the ears, upon the nape of the neck, and on the Fillets.</p>
               <p>The next and laſt obſervation relating to heats, is that in ſeaſonable weather, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning by day ſpring, you have your

               <p>THe firſt fortnight thus over, the firſt day of the ſubſequent fortnight vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit your Horſe early, as before, toſs up his Litter, cleanſe his Stable, rub him down, and dreſs him at all points, as you have been inſtructed: With this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that before you bridle him, you ſhall give him ſomewhat upwards of a quart of Oats before you put on his Bridle, and give him no Hay at any time, but what he eats out of your hand, whether it be one, two or three handfuls at a time, according as he is diſpoſed to eat it, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; when he has eaten his Oats, bridle him, and ride him forth: then let his airing, waterings and his being brought home be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from his uſage in the firſt fortnight, and when you return with him, give him another quart of Oats, or if it be near three pints, if his ſtomach ſerve him to eat them, it matters not, and let him take the Hay out of your hand, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, then toſs up his Litter; dreſs him at all points, letting him ſtand on his Bridle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58037:44"/> an hour and half before he is rubbed throughly. And now in his feeding, this more than formerly muſt be obſerved, take a ſtale loaf of bread of three days old at leaſt: The manner of making of it is thus.</p>
               <p>Grind three Pecks of Beans, with one Peck of Wheat into fine flower or Meal, dreſſed through an indifferent fine range, and made up with ſweet Yeſt, and a little ſpring water, kneaded very painfuly and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuffer it then to lie in the trough a ſpace to riſe and become light; then knead it again, and ſo make it into loaves, as big as ſixpeny ones, and let them ſoak well in an Oven; then taken out hot turn them the up ſide down, and ſuffer them in that manner to cool.</p>
               <p>Three days after the baking and not before, for fear of ſurfeiting your Horſe, you may cut the bread into thin ſhivings, and laying it a while to dry, put in amongſt the Oats, crumbling it ſmall, and give it your Horſe, not exceeding more bread than a pound and a half at a time, the Oats you mix it with being carefully ſifted. This Bait given in the morning firſt of all, you may about Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock give him another portion of Bread and Oats, not differing from the former, and uſe the like ceremonies in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and rubbing him; never forgetting
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58037:44"/> to cleanſe the Stable, if occaſion require it</p>
               <p>This done, let him reſt for the ſpace of two hours, and then again viſit him, and give him a like doſe, and ſo the fourth meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nothing being omitted in his dreſſing, Airing, Watering or Heats, unleſs the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be prevented by the weather as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>On the heating days obſerve that before you lead your Horſe forth, you muſt only give him his quantity of Oats, without either Bread or Hay, and be ſure to cool him well before you bring him into the Stable, and when he is in, let him be well dreſſed, and warmly cloathed; ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Bridle an hour ere you give him his Oats, which being well ordered, muſt not exceed a quart; after the eating of which having a Muzzel ready waſhed, put it on, and ſo without any more ceremony permit him to reſt till about nine in the evening: and about nine coming to him after you have dreſſed and toſſed up his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, give him a quart of Oats; but no Bread nor Hay. Then tucking him up with ſoft wiſps, let him reſt till the morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Now ſince it is come to my turn to ſpeak of the Muzzel, I ſhall for the better ſatisfaction of my Horſe-keeper diſcourſe

               <head>Of Horſes Muzzels, their uſe and goodneſs.</head>
               <p>THe uſe of the Muzzel, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Horſe from feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Litter; biting or gnawing the boards, Rack-ſtaves or Manger; licking Loam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, eating of Hen-dung, or any filthy or noiſome thing that may impair his health or hinder his feeding.</p>
               <p>As for Muzzels, there are divers kinds and divers faſhions, ſome uſeful and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and others exceeding hurtful; of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>The Muzzel made of Leather, and ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full of holes, for divers reaſons ought to be rejected. Firſt, foraſmuch as it is noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and offenſive, be it of what leather it will. Secondly, if it be made of Allomed Leather, as often it happens, it cauſes pains in the Horſes head. Thirdly, if it be liquored, the greaſe cauſes dulneſs, and makes the Horſe loath his meat, rendering him ſick and uneaſie, preventing his reſt, and to his prejudice making him retain his dung longer than otherwiſe he would.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58037:45"/>
               <p>Another Muzzel there is made of Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread knit indifferent cloſe at the bottom, and widening upwards, to the knitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nape of the neck, and this if it be made of ſweet and well dried, and twiſted Packthread, is the moſt proper, beſt and commodious for Summer.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt ſort which I ſhall here mention, is made of double Canvas, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a round bottom bared over with ſmall Tape, in the manner of a chequer, leaving ſquare holes about a quarter of an inch each way for the Horſe to take Air at, and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by loops and ſtrings to the nape of his neck; and this is moſt proper for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but obſerve, that both this and the Packthread one muſt be often waſhed and made clean, leſt they become noiſome and unſavory.</p>

               <p>Having eaten the Oats, uncloath and dreſs him as has been ſhewed, then hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Muzzel, put on his Bridle, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his breaſt and body cloths to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on, drawing his head aloft, and putting into his mouth a new laid Egg, which you muſt oblige him to ſwallow, and after it about half a pint of Beer or Ale, then lead him forth, cauſing him to empty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the caſt Litter, or by ſmelling to old dung. When taking his back, rack him gently for a mile or two, then put him to a harder pace, as a hand-gallop or the like, and bring him to the ſtarting poſt, if there be any one appointed, or if not to ſome other poſt near the place, where you are to perform your Race, and there alighting take of the body and breaſt cloaths, putting on the Saddle again, without them, and mounting him agin make him ſmell to the ſaid poſt, as likewiſe to the weighing poſt; &amp; then run him at three quarters ſpeed, from the beginning of the intended Race to the end, if you perceive he will hold it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain or loſs of wind; but if you perceive it troubleſome to him, then ſlacken your

               <head>Rules to be obſerved in the fourth or laſt fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights keeping, as well in relation to his Dyet as uſage.</head>
               <p>IN this laſt Fortnight you muſt be more circumſpect than in the former, and the firſt thing to be obſerved, is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his bread a degree finer after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>To three pecks of fine Wheat well ſifted put a peck of Beans cleared from the hulls, and grind them together, dreſſing the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er through a Bolter as fine as poſſible, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it up with ſweet Ale-yeſt or Barm,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58037:50"/> and as much Ale as will wet it and make it plyable; then add the whites of twenty Eggs or thereabout, together with new milk, not putting any water into it, then knead it again, and having make it into reaſonable big loaves, bake them well and cool them with the under-cruſt uppermoſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe loaves baked and cooled, after three days cut off the Cruſt, and with Oats well dryed and rubbed between your hands, being alſo winnowed and ſifted, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the beſt ſpelt Beans; bait your Horſe, cutting the bread, and obſerving the quantities of each as in the foregoing fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights.</p>
               <p>In the firſt week of this fortnight, you ſhall obſerve the heating days as before, but in the laſt week you muſt bate one heat, not permitting him to take any heat for the ſpace of five days before the match is to be run, yet may you give him conſiderable Airings to keep up his wind, obſerving that you do not by any means give him a ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but the better to expel the fumes or vapours that may offend him, burn in the Stable Storax, Albanum or Frankincenſe upon a Chafing-diſh of Charcoal or ſmall coal, in the ſcent of which he will take great delight. If at any time in this fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night you deſign to moiſten his meat as it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58037:50"/> is every five or ſix givings convenient, then let it be done with Muſcadel, in which the whites of Eggs have been beaten, and it will the better hearten him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his courſe; as for Hay give him none, unleſs a ſmall quantity after his heatings, which you muſt give him out of your hand, let it be well duſted and exceeding good.</p>
               <p>The ſecond week of the laſt fortnight, unleſs your Horſe be a very foul feeder, you need not uſe the Muzzel till three days before the Match is to be run, but if he be a foul feeder and covet to eat his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bite the Rack-ſtaves, or the like, then put it on the beginning of the week and let it continue on at convenient times till the time he is to run.</p>
               <p>Obſerve to feed your Horſe well, both before and after Airing; the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day you deſign to run for the wager, let his waterings be as formerly; but as for his meat let it be ſcantied a fourth part, both before noon and after.</p>
               <p>Before your Evening Airings, and after be ſure to feed as at noon, but be ſure ſtay not abroad till Sunſet.</p>
               <p>Let him be this day, being the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Match, well ſhod, cooled, and all other things requiſite, that on the day he is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58037:51"/> to run, nothing may be left to do, thereby to trouble or diſturb him, though ſome hold that the Horſe being dreſſed and ſhod with light ſhoos will be ſo ſenſible of what he is to perform the next day, that for pride he will neither eat nor ſleep; but this underſtanding can only remain in an old Horſe-Racing Horſe, who has been often uſed to the ſport, and not in any other; therefore in that caſe 'tis my opinion the offices are better deferred till the morning of the day he is to run; but if otherwiſe, let them be done over-night, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The breading of the Tail, by many is held both an ornament and a help to the Horſe in his running, though according to the opinions of the moſt inquiſitive into that affair, it rather hinders than furthers his ſpeed, by reaſon that in ſtraining the twiſts, drawing the roots of the hairs, put him to pain, and create an unuſual heavineſs, which makes him ſuppoſe that a weight or ſomething elſe is faſtned to his tail, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs it be exceeding long and large it would do better to hang looſe.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the day, your match is to be performed, come to your Horſe pretty betimes, and having taken off his Muzzel, rub his head well, as likewiſe his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58037:51"/> Neck, Shoulders and Legs; then take a quantity of Oats, Maſh them in Muſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, and give them to him to eat, the which if he refuſe, then moiſten another quantity with Whites of Eggs, but if thoſe will not go down with him, then give him Oats well dryed and ſifted, mixed with a ſmall quantity of Wheat, or a ſhiving or two of your fineſt Bread well crumbled with them; but no Beans, let the quantity be very ſmall, leſt it hinder his running. If he be an evil emptier, then lead him to ſuch places as he uſually empties at, and provoke him thereto: but if he is not ſubject long to contain his food, but will empty freely, then you need not move him out of the Stable to empty, but there expect notice when to bring him forth to the Match.</p>
               <p>When you receive the warning, waſh his Snaffle in Muſcadel, and having taken away the Muzzel, put it on: if you perceive any wind to move in your Horſes belly, by reaſon of his emptineſs, give him four or five mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of the meat laſt ſpoken of; and then pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Saddle and Girths with ſhoomakers wax, put it upon his back, gently girding it on that he may ſcarcely feel it, or at leaſt, not ſo as in any wiſe to ſtraiten him: over his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle put a white Linnen cloth; upon that his ordinary cloaths; and over all, the better
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58037:52"/> to ſet him, and make him proud of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you may lay a Counterpain or piece of Arras: and ſo giving him a doſe of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadel, in a ſmall drenching horn, proceed to the place intended for ſtarting.</p>
               <p>In the way permit him to ſmell to any Horſe dung, new or old, to provoke him the better to empty, which will be a great advantage to him in his running: If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to empty, then lead him amongſt Ruſhes, Brakes or Sedge, and thereby whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling provoke him to it: but if that prevail not, then take out ſome of the wiſps he is truſſed with, and break them under him.</p>
               <p>If in your leading him, any foam or froth ariſe in his mouth or elſewhere, wipe it away with a clean Linnen-cloth, and waſh it with dipping it in water, which you ſhall carry with you for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If you are to ride with any perſon, who by reaſon of his being lighter than your ſelf, or that gives you any advantage, ſo that there are weights in the caſe to make both equal, or otherwiſe, as the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, then obſerve that he carries not thoſe weights in his Saddle, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where about himſelf, for if he carry them in the Saddle, they will neither hinder him nor prejudice the Horſe, but be as if he did
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58037:52"/> carry none, and then you had as good ride with him on equal terms: but if your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be that he ſhall carry them about him, then is the advantage much on your ſide.</p>
               <p>As to the ground you muſt likewiſe have ſpecial regard, which you muſt take from your heats and breathings, that is, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice whether your Horſe affects high or low ground, hard or ſoft, and if you can poſſibly without any ſignal diſadvantage, keep him to ſuch ground in his courſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſider, and all things brought to a point; when you are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the ſtarting Poſt, uncloath your Horſe, rub well his legs with wiſps, cleanſe his feet, and ſpirt cool water into his mouth, then mount your rider.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Then ſtarting fair, force on without controle,</l>
                  <l>And if your Horſe be good, ne'r doubt the Goal.</l>

               <p>When you come to take a view of your Horſe, narrowly inſpect him, and if you perceive him heavy and dull of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Looſe, Coſtive, Short-breath, Loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of meat; his Eyes glazed or dim, his Hair ſtaring, his Hair ſtrangely diſco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loured, if he ſtagger in his pace, be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ratling or ſhort Cough, Dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his head, Yellow under his upper Lip or in his eyes.

               <head>How to know the State of a Horſes body by his Dung.</head>
               <p>I If your Horſe dung be criſp, neither too hard nor too ſoft, of a pale colour, ſmell ſtrong, ſomething ſavouring of the ordure of a man, ſound and in good health, then it is a ſign your Horſe is luſty and in health, clean and well fed.</p>
               <p>If it be well coloured, yet if it fall from the Horſe in round hard balls, as near as may be of a bigneſs, then it denotes your Horſe evilly fed, having too much Hay, too little Corn, and permitted to feed too much upon his Litter.</p>
               <p>If it fall in round knops, hard, and of colour black, or brown, it denotes exceſs of heat in the body of your Horſe; if it appear greaſie, it denotes foulneſs, and that in him remains Molten greaſe, that cannot find a paſſage out: If with his Dung he voids greaſe, that is white and clear, then it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes that the Molten, and foul greaſe will kindly come away; but if you perceive it putrified or corrupted, which you may by its yellowneſs, then it betokens by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the length of its continuance in the Horſes body, corruption and putrefaction,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58037:54"/> the which if it be not timely removed by ſcourings, will cauſe dangerous diſtempers. If his Dung appear red and hard, then it betokens that the Horſe has been too much put to it in his Heats, and Courſing, and if he be not kept warm and well dyeted, Coſtiveneſs will follow. If his Dung be pale and looſe, it betokens cold, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by moiſt feeding.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>What is to be obſerved from the ſtate of your Horſes body.</head>
               <p>IN the outward appearance of a Horſe, there is nothing more common than for ſome men to be deceived: Therefore it will not be amiſs, if I lay down ſome rules worthy of obſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then there are ſome Horſes round, plump, and to appearance fat and well fleſhed, when they are nothing ſo, the cauſe of which deluſion ariſes from their being ſhort from Head to Tail; well ſet, large buttock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well ſhouldered, and full ſided.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are ſome Horſes that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be in good caſe, yet they will to the eye appear lean, and their Ribs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear bare, nay when they are fat, foul, and full of greaſe and groſs humours; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many skilful Jockies have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as likewiſe Farriers, who ſuppoſing them to be in good caſe, have neglected to apply thoſe remedies which were needfull, till
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58037:55"/> ſuch time as the humours have ingendered divers diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Many Horſes will appear to be fat and foggy, by the outſide, when inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are clean and in good order, and ſo on the contrary, a Horſe that appears lean will often be groſs and foul within, as is ſaid. Now to Remedy this overſight, handle your Horſe diligently on the Ribs, and more particularly on his hindmoſt ſhort-ribs, and obſerve well that if the fleſh feel looſe and ſoft, that your fingers dent in without much ſtreſs, then conclude your Horſe to be foul; if it prove firm and hard on all other places, the hinder Rib excepted, then is he more foul and full of Molten greaſe, and evil humours, which muſt be voided by ſcouring and exerciſe, the latter to diſſolve it, and the former to bring it away, though the Horſe to the eye appear poor and ill favoured.</p>
               <p>If you upon ſearch find your Horſe to be fat, thick, and to feeling, as it were, cloſe between the Chaps, or his Jaws appear to be over fleſhy, bearing out, it denotes much foulneſs, in both head and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but if he be thin, clean, and here and there lumps or kernels are to be felt within his chaps, it only denotes cold newly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58037:56"/> taken, by being over-heated, ſtanding in the rain, or in a damp Stable.</p>

               <p>IF you obſerve your Horſes ſtones to hang lank, and find the ſinews to be limber, or hanging long from the body, then your Horſe is not in good temper, but altogether out of order, occaſioned by greaſe, or other foul humours, but on the contrary, if they be cloſe knit and drawn near to his body, even round, and well couched, then he is in good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health.</p>

               <p>CErtain it is there are good Horſes of all Colours, though I muſt confeſs ſome Colours are better than otherſome, both for beauty and the diſpoſition of the Horſe; and of theſe in their order. For beauty the Daple-gray is accounted the beſt; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſervice, moſt approve of the Bay-Horſe, as alſo of the Brown. The Black, with ſome Silver hairs, for ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and courage, eſpecially, if he have one white-foot, or a blazing-ſtar in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. As for the Sorrel; the Black with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any white about him, and the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iron-gray, they are accounted Cholerick. The Bright-bay, the Fleabitten, and the Black with white marks are of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin conſtitution. The Black, Pybald, White, Kite-colour, Yellow or Dun are of a Phlegmatick conſtitution. The Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, Mouſe-dun, Red-bay, and Blewiſh-gray are Melancholy. And thus I have deciphered the particular colours; of which in the Series of this Treatiſe I ſhall have further occaſion to ſpeak.</p>

               <head>What motion in your Horſe is to be obſerved, upon divers occaſions.</head>
               <p>THe Paces incident and moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for any Horſe, is either Rack, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Trot or Gallop and to divers ends they ſerve: if you deſign your Horſe for the Wars, then a lofty Trot or Prancing is beſt, as likewiſe if he be deſigned for Running or Hunting, and whether he be well addicted to this motion upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, you ſhall perceive by his croſs
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58037:59"/> moving his Limbs, as when the near hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derleg, and far foreleg move together at one and the ſame inſtant, and in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nearer your Horſe takes his Limbs from the ground; the opener, evener and ſhorter is his tread or pace: but if he take them up uneaſie or ſlovenly, after a ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling manner as it were, then it denotes ſtumbling, lameneſs or ſome ſuch like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. If your Horſe tread narrow, or croſs, it ſignifies he is ſubject to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and can never tread ſure; if he takes his ſtep askew or uneven, it ſignifies he is given to tire and faint, and will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any long journey or hard ſervice. If he tread long, that denotes him ſubject to ſtrains, ſprains and over-reaches: but as to the other motions, in particular.</p>

               <p>IF for eaſe and pleaſure you chuſe your Horſe, then the motion he can be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, is the Amble, which is oppoſite to Trotting. As thus, both the feet on one ſide muſt have equal motion, that is, the far foreleg, and the far hinderleg, which muſt move juſt even, large, ſmooth and withall ſwift; for if your Horſe-tread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry or falſe, it takes away the eaſineſs of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58037:60"/> his pace; and if he treads ſhort, he rids no more ground than if he went a round foot pace; if he treads rough, it denotes roul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſhuffling manner, and is a falſe pace, which by ſome unskilfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager has been taught him, and ſo it is that he will ſoon fall out of into a Trot, or in a ſhort time forget it.</p>

               <head>Of Racking.</head>
               <p>RAcking is a convenient and neceſſary pace for Buck-hunting, Riding-poſt or the like, being between a pace and Full-gallop, by ſome called the running ſpeed, yet little differs from Ambling, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is more ſwift, and of a ſhorter tread, though the ground is better ridded in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, yet this pace is more eaſie, and by ſome highly approved; but for it, there is no certain rule, it being a motion natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to moſt Horſes that are brought to the Amble.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Gallop.</head>
               <p>THe Gallop is a motion exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and is moſt appropriated to Trotting Horſes, becauſe that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58037:60"/> out of their Trot, they have no other pace but the Gallop, as likewiſe a Horſe well uſed to Racking, will naturally take this motion: but the Pacer above all is the moſt awkard to be brought to it, though in a while with good uſage and gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions he will take it exceeding well: the cauſe why at firſt he is averſe to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, for that he having been trained to a ſet pace; when he is forced to a ſwifter motion ſomewhat of the like nature, he by ſtraining to ſwiften his pace, ſcambles with his legs, but when he underſtands the alteration, which he will after a months uſage, he will be prone enough to take it upon all occaſions; yet too much Gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping will prove prejudicial to his Pacing, and render it more hard by reaſon of ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore, in my opinion it would be beſt for them that can afford it, to keep a Horſe for every motion. In Gallopping eſpecially, theſe things are to be obſerved, that from the ground he raiſes his feet nimbly, but not too high. That he neither rouleth nor beateth himſelf; but that ſtretching out his forelegs, his hinderlegs keep time cleaverly and ſwiftly, that he neither cutteth under his knee, neither croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth nor ſtrikes one foot againſt another, but with his far ſore-foot ſtill leadeth. If he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58037:61"/> have theſe vertues, he is a true thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced Gallopper. If your Horſe Gallop ſhort and round, raiſing his forefeet, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes him ſtrong, but not ſwift, and is moſt fit for the Wars. If he Gallop ſlow and ſure, then appropriate him to Travail; but if you perceive he handles his feet confuſed, and ſeems to Gallop painfully, it denotes his ſinews ſhrunk, and he will never prove a Gallopper, but will be ſubject to lameneſs: and thus much ſhall ſuffice as to the motions of Horſes.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Rules to be obſerved, in the Stature of a Horſe; Marks whereby to know his goodneſs.</head>
               <p>THe Buyer in the Stature of a Horſe muſt conſider his ability, according to the imployment or uſe he deſigns him; the biggeſt and ſtrongeſt are fit for laborious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as Drawing, carrying of burthens, double carriage, and the like. The Horſes of a middle Stature are fitteſt for the Saddle of pleaſure, and the ſmaller for ſuch uſes as they are capable to ſerve to. As for the Marks to be obſerved by the buyer, either of goodneſs or badneſs, they are many, and ſo numerous are the defects in Horſes, that they cannot without great curioſity and narrow obſervance be deciphered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58037:61"/> I ſhall lay down divers general Rules, the which being well obſerved will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many deceits.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then if you deſign to purchaſe, after you have ſatisfied your ſelf in his breed, colour, ſtature, and motion, by the Rules aforeſaid. Then his Saddle and cloaths being off, ſtand juſt before him, take a ſtrict view of his Countenance, and the chearfulneſs of his Face, for according to the chearfulneſs or dullneſs thereof is your Horſe to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, the one preſaging his goodneſs, and the other his badneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve his Ears, if they be ſharp, thin, pricked and ſmall, always ſtanding or moving, or if they be ſomewhat long, well ſet on, well carried, and no ways lolling, then is it a mark of beauty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and goodneſs; but on the contrary, ſigns of dullneſs, indiſpoſition, and of a ſurly temper.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If his face be lean, his forehead bearing or ſwelling outward; the Mark or Feather in his Face ſet high above his eyes, or ſet on the top of his eyes; if he have a Star of white in his forehead, or a white ſtreak, a ſnip of white on his noſe or lip, it denotes goodneſs in the Horſe. But if his face be dull, heavy, cloudy, his forehead flat, and his head big and fat, and have none of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58037:62"/> beforeſaid marks of goodneſs, then he is nought; and although he have thoſe marks, yet if his Star or ſtreak ſtand awry, and where the ſnip is, or ſhould be; his noſe be bald or the like, then is he notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an evil Breed and defective.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obſerve that his eyes are large, round, black, ſparkling, and that the black of the eye fills the pit of the outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſo that little white is viſible, then it betokens beauty and goodneſs; but if his eyes are uneven, look askew, wrinkled or ſmall, dull, heavy and not quick moving, it ſignifies not only defect as to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comelineſs; but alſo a diſtempered and imperfect Horſe, of an evil breed. If his eyes be Red, Fiery, take heed of Moon-eyes, which are not much diſtant from blindneſs, if for the greateſt part White or Wall-ey'd, then it ſignifies weakneſs in the Horſe, a weak ſight, and ſubject to ſtart at every object that ſwiftly is preſented to his view. If you perceive white ſpecks in the eyes, then it denoteth that he is in danger of having the Pin and Web, Pearl or the like infirmity, tending to blindneſs; if watery and bloody, then ſubject to hot Rheumes: if mattery, it is occaſioned through exceſſive riding, ſurfeit, feſtered Rheumes or ſtrains. If his eyes appear dead, dull
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58037:62"/> or hollow, ſunk as it were in his head, then is he inclining to blindneſs, and will not long continue his perfect ſight; or is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by an old Stallion on an old Mare. If his eyes are moſt white, and the black but ſmall, ſo that the white appears much in ſight as the balls move, it denotes weakneſs and an evil temper.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Obſerve his Chaps or Cheeks, and if you perceive the bones thin, lean, and between them a wide ſpace. The Throple or wind-pipe big, no knots nor kernels near it, and the Jaws ſo great that the neck lyes as it were between them, it denotes the Horſe to be ſound and to have a good and long wind, as likewiſe to be of great courage; but on the contrary, if his Chaps or Cheeks be ſeeming fat or thick, the ſpace between them cloſed with tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid fleſh; and the Wind-pipe ſmall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with kernels, then is the Horſe ſhort-winded, ſubject to the Strangles Glaunders, and divers other diſtempers. If his Jaws be ſtrait, inſomuch that his neck bears over, or ſwells above them, unleſs by ſome diſtemper occaſioned, then it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies foulneſs, purſineſs, and that the Horſe is ſubject to colds and ſurfeits. If the ſwelling be long, cloſe, and feel hard, then will he be ſubject to the Winds or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:58037:63"/>
               <p>Sixthly, Obſerve his Noſtrils, the which if they prove wide, large, open and dry, ſo that upon any ſnorting or ſtraining of the Horſe, the inward redneſs appears, his Muzzel ſmall, and he deep mouthed, his lips equally meeting; then is he a Horſe of good wind, good mettal, and of a ſound conſtitution: but if the contrary, then is he ſubject to divers diſtempers, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove a good Horſe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Obſerve his breaſt, the which if it be broad, ſwelling out hard, well boned, and the like, it denoteth ſtrength, comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and continuance: but on the contrary, if it be narrow or bending inwards, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth the Horſe to be apt to ſtumble, of a weak ſpirit, and altogether unfit for the performance of any great labour; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much deformity.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Obſerve from his Elbow to his Knee, that his thighs be well brawned, clean and ſolidly fleſhed: for if ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments are wanting, and the fleſh feel ſoft and ſpungy, then it denotes weakneſs in your Horſe, as the other doth ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Take eſpecial notice of his knees, that they are of due proportion, not one higher than the other, well joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſinewed and ſtrongly knit, lean, even, which betokens ſtrength and comelineſs;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58037:63"/> when on the other hand, if they be Groſs, Gouty, Scared, want Hair in ſome places, it denotes weakneſs, ſtumbling and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned Jade.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Obſerve his legs; if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, upon handling, lean, rather flat than round, full of ſinews, bending inward, without ſeams or hair broken: It denotes a ſound ſubſtantial Horſe, and one that will indure much labour. When marks, on the contrary, as fleſhy legs diſtorted, bending outward or the like, denote a weak unſerviceable and tyring Horſe.</p>
               <p>What has been before ſpoken of, being narrowly obſerved by the Buyer, let him alſo take particular notice of what as yet remains untouch'd; which in their order, for his better inſtructions, I ſhall ſet down.</p>

               <head>Obſervations on the Paſterns.</head>
               <p>WHen you buy, or would know the well going of a Horſe for many years, obſerve the Paſtern joynt, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern. The firſt of which being clear and well knit together, and the laſt ſhort, ſtrong and upright, denotes a good firm and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial tread, but if the former appear big or puffy, ſeeming ſomewhat ſwelled, then is the Horſe ſubject to ſinew Strains and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58037:64"/> Gourdings, or if the latter be long, weakly knit, and bending in and out in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it denotes a weak Horſe, and one ſoon tired.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Obſervations on the Hoof.</head>
               <p>THe beſt Hoof is the black ſmooth and tough Hoof, rather inclining to long, than round and well hollowed, ſubject much to ſounding. As for the white Hoof it is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and will not well bear a ſhoo. The Hoof that is rugged and full of ſeams or wrinkles, denotes Old-Age in the Horſe that he came of an old decayed ſtock, or has been addicted to over-heats. As for the brittle Hoof it is worſt of all, for it will carry no ſhoo. If the Hoof be more than ordinary round, the Horſe will be apt to trip and ſtumble, eſpecially in deep ways; or if he be but put to an extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Hoof be flat and Pumiced, it denotes foundering. The Hoof that is hollow and empty, betokens the inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, by reaſon of ſome founder bruiſe, or wound not throughly ſearched or cured. Take likewiſe notice of the Crown of the Hoof, and if you perceive the fleſh flat, and the hair ſmooth, then is all in good order in that part; but if the Hair be rough, riſing, the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58037:64"/> fleſh ſwelling, full of knops or ſcabs, ſcared or broken, then it denotes a Ring bone, Quitter-bone, or Crown-ſcab.</p>

               <head>Things to be obſerved in the ſetting on of the Head, Creſt and Maine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving viewed your Horſe narrowly before, come to his right-ſide, and there take eſpecial notice that his head be placed neither too high nor too low, but that it ſtand as it were in a direct line, evenly carryed, and for his Neck, let it be ſmall at the ſetting on of the head, long, and ſtill growing deeper, as it deſcends towards the ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with a high ſtrong and thin Main, long, ſoft, and indifferently well curling, which denotes the Horſe not only of a good breed, but are greatly ornamental; for if the Head be ill ſet on, though in it ſelf it be well ſhaped, 'tis a great blemiſh to the beauty of the Horſe. If you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any riſing or ſwelling in the nape of the neck, it is a ſymptom of the Pole-evil or a fiſtula. If your Horſe have a ſhort thick neck, or if it be fat and falling at the Withers; if the Creſt be low, thick, falling, and weak, they are tokens of dullneſs in the Horſe; as alſo does an extraordinary thick Maine: little hair on the Maine, denotes fury, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58037:65"/> if it fall off, then is it occaſioned by the diſtemper called the Worm in the Maine; the Itch or Mangineſs, which there are breeding, though perhaps not apparent by any other ſymptoms.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>What is to be obſerved in the Back-ribs, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Belly and Stones.</head>
               <p>TAke ſpecial notice that the chine of the back be broad, ſtrait and even; the Ribs ſtrong, well compoſed, at equal diſtance, bending out Archwiſe. That his Fillets be upright, ſtrong and ſhort; and that the ſpace between the laſt Rib and the Huckle-bone exceed not a handful. As for his Belly, let it fall down indifferently well, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were by degrees, from his loyns to his foreparts; and his Stones carried even, and not hanging down, or ſwagging. All theſe denote perfection in a Horſe; but if the Chine be narrow, he is nought for the Saddle, and if put to it, very much ſubject to gauling; to be Saddle-backed, Sway-backed, or have the back bending, denotes weakneſs. Flat Ribs betoken hide-boundneſs. Hanging long or weak Fillets, denote him not capable of clambering, or journeying in hilly Countries, nor of carrying
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58037:65"/> a burthen. If his belly be clung, or over gaunt, his Stones uneven or dangling, they are ſymptoms of ſickneſs, foundering or dullneſs, and unaptneſs to labour.</p>

               <p>If the Thighs or Gaskings be even, and let down well, to the middle joynt, full of ſinews, thick and brawny, they are ſigns of Beauty and ſtrength, but if they appear Slender or Lank, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes deformity, and weakneſs in your Horſe.</p>

               <p>LEt our buyer obſerve that the hinder legs be clean, lean, and full of ſtrong ſinews, ſomewhat inclining to fatneſs, for if they be fat, fleſhy, and tumid, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the Horſe not capable of hard labour, and that the greaſe is Molten in them. If you perceive any ſcabs above the Paſterns, then it denoteth him to have the ſcratches, or if a chop appear there, then is he affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Rheumes.</p>
               <p>As for the ſetting on the Tail, it is worthy only of this obſervation, that where there is a good Buttock, the Tail cannot be evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet on; and where there is a bad Buttock, it cannot ſtand right: A Tail well ſet on ought to ſtand broad, high, and flat, couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat inwards.</p>
               <p>The obſervations neceſſary to be made on the Cambrels of your Horſe, are theſe; firſt, obſerve well the middle joynt behind, and if there you perceive it repleniſhed with firm ſmooth skin-bones and ſinews, a little bending, then is that part of the Horſe ſound and beautiful. Secondly, If in making a narrow inſpection, you do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58037:66"/> Sores, Chaps, inward bought or bending, then it denotes the Horſe to be troubled with a Sellander: but if all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the joynt, you perceive it tumid or ſwelled, it is a ſign he has received ſome blow or bruiſe; yet if it be a particular ſwelling in the hollow part, Pit, or proud &amp; full on the inſide of the vein; and the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be ſoft, then is it a Blood Spavin; or if hard, a bone Spavin: but if it appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, before the Knuckle, then conclude it to be a Curb.

               <p>The ſecond year he changeth two of his fore teeth, one above, and the other beneath, each in the middle of the Rows, of the Gatherers, which come up browner and larger than the other.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Office of the Farrier, and what is chiefly therein to be conſidered.</head>
               <p>HE that will be accounted an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced able Farrier, muſt not only be skilled in ſhooing, and dreſſing, but in all the parts of a Horſes body, thereby to know from whence proceeds the original cauſe of any diſtemper, how and by what means it was generated, and the more effectually to apply ſuch remedies as may remove the diſtemper, and work a perfect cure: to do which, note theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſeat of life is in the Brain, Heart and Liver, from whence it operates in, and diſpoſes every member; and for that end, thoſe by many are called the three principal members, to which ſome would add a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> the Stones, but that addition by the wiſeſt practitioners has been rejected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſinews which are theſe, two white ſinews or Tendons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the Noſe, and paſſing through the neck and back, branch into the forelegs, and end in the hinderlegs, taking their liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all the four feet. Two ſinews
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58037:70"/> called the Main ſinews, which deſcend from the Brain, and paſſing down the cheeks, faſten the Jaws. Three, from the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the firſt joynt of the Arms, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs, beſides two other great ſinews; four great ſinews from the knees to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, with the ſame number in the hinder part above, as well within as without the forepart of the breaſt, are ten ſinews great and ſmall. From the Reins of the back to the Stones are four great ſinews or Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and another great ſinew which runs to the end of the Tail: To conclude, a Horſe has great and ſmall ſinews 29. or as ſome will have it 30.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As to the Veins in a Horſe, through which the blood circulates the whole body; they are many, yet ſeeing they all center in the Liver, the ſeat and fountain of blood, diſtributing it into every part: divers are of opinion that a Horſe has properly but one vein, which is called the Median, and that when ever the blood is corrupted, or that vein is afflicted with wind or any infirmity, it diſpenſing it through all the branches, afflicts at once the whole body of the Horſe. Thoſe branches, that aſcend to the head and upper parts of the body, are called aſcendants, and thoſe that run down into their legs and nether parts of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58037:70"/> the body deſcendants, and through theſe branches, whether the beaſt ſleep or wake, the blood continues its courſe, as indeed it does in all creatures, whoſe bulk admit a free paſſage, Ebbing and Flowing like the Ocean, by the courſe of the Moon. Now the things herein chiefly to be conſidered, are the Branches from whence upon ſundry occaſions, it is moſt proper to take blood; which indeed are many conſiſtant to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper: for the branch is to be opened, as it either affects the blood, or is ſeated in the body of the Horſe.</p>
               <p>But the Veins moſt convenient to be opened, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Neck, in the weeping veins under the Ears, and about the head in ſix other places, as in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late-veins in the Tongue, in the Flank-veins, in the breaſt, and Spur-veins, in the four members, <hi>viz.</hi> the Legs, Thighs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns and Feet, and indeed in moſt veins, according as the diſtemper is ſeated, by bloodletting, being great, as in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter will appear.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>To what end Phlebotomy, or bloodletting ſerves.</head>
               <p>THe opening the Temple vein eaſeth pain in the head, cauſed by cold Rheumes, Feavers, Drowſineſs, Stavars,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58037:71"/> yellows, Frenzy, Sleepy-evil, Falling-evil or any grief afflicting the Eyes or Brain. The opening of the Weeping veins, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good to prevent blindneſs, and to cure the diſtempers in the eyes, as Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hot Rheumes, Haws, Pin and Web, Pearls, blood-ſhotten and the like. The opening the Palate-veins, cures or pervents the Lampaſs, or inward ſickneſs, as Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vars, Anticor, Yellows, Drowſineſs, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, Tirings, and many times cureth the Strangles, Quinſie, Swelling of the kernels, Puſtles, Inflammation, or Glaunders, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if you cauſe him to drink the blood mixed with a little Bay-ſalt. The next veins opened help the Yellows, Farcins, Stavars, Mangies, Agues, Feavours, Surfeits, Scabs, Glaunders and the like; and often prevent ſickneſs in your Horſe or Mare. The opening the palate, or breaſt veins, prevent or help the Anticor, Moore-foundering, occaſioned by molten greaſe, contracted in the body by hard riding, it likewiſe preventeth diſeaſes in the Liver, Lungs and other internal parts, is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be done upon any hurt or ſprain in the Shoulder, to prevent Lameneſs. The opening the two thigh veins, helpeth foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the forefeet, Splint, Screw-ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, Mallender, or the like infirmity.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58037:71"/> To bleed the four Shackle veins before, is good againſt the Crown-ſcab, Quitter-bone and the like diſtemper incident to the feet of a Horſe or Mare. To bleed the Spur-veins is excellent good for the Moore-founder, Farcine in the ſide, ſwelling under the belly or the like. The Toe-veins being opened do help Frettizing, foundering, Hoof-bound or any grief, occaſioned by the Horſes beating his Hoofs upon hard ſtony way: Bleeding the two thigh-veins behind, eaſeth the grief of the kidnies, ſwelling in the hinder legs, Foundering, Scratches, piſſing of Blood, occaſioned by overſtraining, or the weakneſs of the Reins, Back or Belly, and infirmity in the Guts; as likewiſe the Curb, Spavin, and ſuch other diſtempers or griefs, as proceed from rankneſs or impurity of Blood. To open the Shackle veins behind, is exceeding good to prevent foundering, or any pain the Horſe is ſubject to have in his feet. To open the Flank-veins, is exceeding good in caſe of a Feavour, Swelling in the Stones, Poverty, or the Felt-worm. And laſtly, to bleed the Tail-vein often, prevents the Mange, Scabs, Itch, and falling off of the Hair. So that the number of veins that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally opened upon divers occaſions are Thirty: the opening of which greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58037:72"/> to the health of the Horſe or Mare, not only by preventing diſtempers, as has been before ſaid, but frequently without any other application, by taking away the effects, cauſe the grief to ceaſe, or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the body of the Horſe, the better to receive ſuch effectual medicines as will work his cure, and diſpoſe outward wounds, bruiſes and the like, to ſuch a temper that they heal without much difficulty.</p>

               <p>IT is not the leaſt part of the Farriers Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to conſider and well underſtand the nature, and qualities of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Humours, that go to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of all creatures. And firſt as the four Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Water and Earth, give life and Nutriment to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures. So the four Humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler, Blood, Phlegm and Melancholy are the principal Agitators in the bodies of all Creatures, and as it were compoſe them, or at leaſt preſerve them; for without either no creature can ſubſiſt. Choler, by reaſon of its heat, being alluded to Fire; Blood, by reaſon of its heat and moiſture to Air; Phlegm, by reaſon of its coldneſs and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to Water; and Melancholy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its cold and dryneſs, to Earth: as for Choler, its ſeat is in and near the Liver, which by reaſon of its heat and dryneſs accords with the blood, which has its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Liver, and from thence diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf throughout the whole body, nouriſhing and preſerving it in all parts:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58037:73"/> Phlegm has its chief ſeat in and about the Brain, that ſeat of life, altogether affecting Cold. Melancholy occupieth the Spleen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the groſs and excremental part of blood and choler, deſcending from the Liver. As for the Offices or diſpoſitions of theſe humours, they are four, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth concoction, and voiding of Excrements. Blood nouriſhes the body.

               <head>How to know by the Colour of a Horſe, to which of the four aforeſaid Humors he is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable, and how thereupon to order him for the prevention, or curing ſuch diſtempers as he is moſt ſubject to.</head>
               <p>TO know the better to prepare your Medicines, neceſſary to be given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſundry occaſions; it is firſt neceſſary that you know which of the four aforeſaid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is moſt predominant in your Horſe, which cannot better be diſcerned than by his Colour or complexion: note then if he be cole-black without any white, a bright Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel or an Iron-gray unchangeable, that will neither turn to a Flea-bitten, White, or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gray, then is he moſt ſubject to Choler,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58037:74"/> by reaſon of the great heat in him, often incident to inflammation of the Liver, Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Peſtilential Feavours; and in that caſe you muſt, to prevent theſe diſtempers, give him medicines to purge Choler, but let them not be of a quality too much ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, leſt they impair his ſtrength to that degree, that he never after recover it: for all cholerick Horſes, though they be fierce and fiery, are but of ſmall ſtrength. If your Horſe be coloured either Bright-bay, or Dark-bay, neither ſcouling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, maughy mouthed, or white flanked, or a white Fleabitten, white Lyard, like ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or black with a white Star, white Raſh, or white foot, then is he Sanguin; and the diſeaſes to which he is moſt ſubject, are the Glaunders, Conſumption of the Liver, Leproſie or ſuch other diſtempers as are cauſed by infection. As for the Horſes of a Snguin complection, they are for the moſt part of a ſtrong conſtitution, and will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſtrong medicines, without impairing their ſtrength, if the medicines be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of extraordinary hot ingredients, to over-heat the blood.</p>
               <p>If your Horſes colour be Milk-white, Py-bald, Yellow, Dun, Kite-colour, or any the like colours, in mixture, then is he Phlegmatick, being ſlow by nature, and apt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58037:74"/> to loſe his fleſh, ſubject to cold Rheums, Head-ach, Cough, Staggers, and indeed all diſtempers proceeding from cold or watery diſtillations, and therefore muſt have hot medicines, that is, ſimples of a hot and ſtrong working nature that may operate upon the Maſs of Phlegm, which generates the diſtempers.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be of a Dark-bay colour, having long white hairs like Goats hairs on his legs, Ruſſet, Cheſnut, Aſh-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Gray or Mouſe-dun, then does Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly abound in him, and the diſtempers he is moſt ſubject to, are the inflammation of the Spleen, Dropſie, Frenzy, and ſuch like dull and Melancholy diſtempers; and therefore require cold and moiſt medicines, thoſe of a dry or hot quality being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurtful and unprofitable. Their ſtrength is greater than it appears to be, and for the moſt part they are fit for ſervile labours, and thus much of the four Elementary humours: now there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Horſes mixed with all the aforeſaid colours, or ſome three or four of them; in ſuch a caſe, note that thoſe Horſes have thoſe humours moſt predominant, of which their colour is moſtly, according to what has been ſaid, and ſo conſequently ought the medicines to be prepared with regard
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58037:75"/> to the nature of the ſickneſs for; if it has continued long, and the Horſe be infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thereby, then you muſt not give him over ſtrong potions, but if he be young and luſty, not having languiſhed under the force of the diſtemper; then any well compoſed ſutable medicine will not be amiſs, but as to medicines in particular I ſhall ſpeak at large hereafter.</p>

Not to ſuffer him to eat or drink after exerciſe, or a journey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is throughly col'd. 12. With his Provender give him wholſome ſimples,

               <head>Of Sickneſs, Dangerous to Horſes; and its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</head>
               <p>THe main cauſe of moſt Internal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers in Horſes proceeds either from over violent heats in exerciſe, as when the Horſe hath his greaſe molten, or the heart over charged with vitiated blood, ſo that the Pores or paſſages are ſo ſtopped, that the Vital ſpirits diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throughout the body, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn turn to their center, nor the heart be

               <p>Another cauſe there is, which proceedeth from cold occaſioned through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the keeper, in not regarding him before and after a journey or exerciſe, as he ought; which once taken, troubles his head with pains and dullneſs, making him look heavy and dull eyed; the root of the Tongue being often inflamed and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

               <p>A third cauſe there is cometh by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable eating or over eating, which frequently begets a ſurfeit, eſpecially if he eat unwholſome food. If he eat to exceſs, it many times proves mortal, by reaſon it creates unwholeſome vapours, noiſome fumes and the like, which aſcending from the ſtomach to the brain, poyſon and infect it, or if the Horſe eſcape with life, yet ſeldom miſſes to have Stavers, or Frenzy: if the food he has eaten be unwholſome, raw or out of ſeaſon, then it breeds diſeaſes by producing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58037:76"/> corrupt vitiated blood or infectious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery humours, from which proceed the Yellows, Farcines, Feavers, Mangineſs and the like, which infecting the heart, ſtopping the free paſſage of the ſtomach, and diſperſing throughout the body, leaves no member free from affliction.</p>
               <p>A fourth cauſe there is, which we may call accidental, which is when a Horſe taketh in poyſon with his food, or receiveth a wound, or extraordinary bruiſe, which inflames the blood, and makes each part become hot and feaveriſh, the which by degrees turns to many evil diſtempers that end but with the life of the Horſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on this occaſion, there is nothing more neceſſary than to apply pertinent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in time, ere the malady has taken root.</p>

               <head>How to diſcern by divers ſymptoms any mortal ſickneſs in a Horſe.</head>
               <p>HAving laid down the original cauſes of moſt mortal ſickneſſes, I ſhall now proceed to let you underſtand how they may be known by the ſundry ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that forerun, or attend them according to the opinion of the moſt expert pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners in this Art. If the ſickneſs be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58037:77"/> occaſioned through immoderate heats or journeying, then it is ſignified by the heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his countenance, ſwelling of his legs and other limbs, but his hinder legs eſpecially by the looſneſs and ſcouring of his body, at the beginning of the ſickneſs, ſhort and hot breath, and a loathing or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his meat. If the ſickneſs proceeds from cold, then it is known by a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt Countenance, Drowſineſs, and deſire of ſleep; Puſtils or hard knots under the Caul; and many times by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Kernels, and ſwellings as high as the roots of the Ears, attended by a moiſt and inward ſounding cough, and the like.</p>
               <p>If the ſickneſs be occaſioned by a ſurfeit taken after the manner aforeſaid, then the ſigns or ſymptoms are violent pains in the head, ſo that he will not by reaſon of the dullneſs it occaſions, be able to hold it up to the Rack: His Eyes will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appear dull and ſunk in his Head, his Ears pricked up, and the tops of them cold; as alſo his upperlip and ſheath; Reeling and Staggering as he goes, the which if it be delayed will turn to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that Madneſs be known by his eager biting the Manger, or Rackſtaves, and often beating his head againſt the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58037:77"/> Wall; you may likewiſe know whether the diſtemper has tainted the Brain, by the yellowneſs of his Eyes, Lips, and Tongue.</p>
               <p>The ſymptoms to know accidental ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs occaſioned by wounds and the like, are unuſual Sweats, tremblings, a ſweat or Froth at roots of his Ears, upon the Flanks behind, the Shoulders, and againſt the Heart, at other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times glowing and burning in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, againſt the Heart, and inſide of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs, and of the hinderlegs, dry and hot in the Mouth, inflammation in the Tongue, a loathing of meat, and deſire of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which after he hath drunk his fill, he will be deſirous to hold his mouth.</p>
               <p>Now to prevent any of theſe ſickneſs, if you find him a little diſtempered, or any thing inclining to be out of order, let him blood, and for three mornings ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him a Diapente-drink, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him warm, let him faſt for three hours after, then give him a Maſh of Beans, Bran and Oats, and a little knop of Hay, but if it ſo happen that you are unprovided with Diapente, which no Farrier ought to be, then take a handful of Celendine, waſh it well, roots and leaves, adding to it Wormwoord and Rue, half a handful of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58037:78"/> both, boil them in a pottle of ALE or Beer, till they come to the quantity of a quart, to which well ſtrained put half a pound of ſweet-butter, and two ounces of Treacle, which ingredients well mixed, give him blood warm.</p>
               <p>If you would fortifie your Horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any diſtemper, then obſerve all the twelve rules before laid down, relating to health and long life or continuance, and moreover, if you intend to put him to Graſs, after he hath long ſtood in the Houſe, then having let him blood every day, abate of his cloaths, till you have brought him to none, thereby to render him hardy, and able to indure cold, but be ſure you put him not into wet Paſture, where damp and noiſome Air ariſe from Ditches, Rivers, Fens or Quagmires; and before you turn him out of the Stable, for three mornings ſucceſſively give him drink made as followeth.</p>

               <p>IT is to be obſerved that you ought to take a due proportion of blood from the Horſe, according to his age, ſtrength, or the quality of the diſtemper. If he be a ſtrong Horſe, full grown, take from him four times the quantity from him, as you take from a Colt of a year old: but if he be an old Horſe and weak of conſtitution,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58037:84"/> twice the quantity. If he have a Pleuriſie or any violent diſtemper, occaſioned by rankneſs of blood, then you may let him blood, if you ſee the diſtemper threaten his life, three days together, but not ſuffer him to bleed exceſſively at one time. The cauſes for which Horſes ought to bleed, are either to preſerve health by diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperfluity of blood, that burns or heats the veins; to divert ſickneſs, or chear the vital ſpirits, by giving the blood a free and uncontrouled paſſage, after which you muſt moderately chafe or walk him, to make the blood fill thoſe veins or branches that were emptied, and to make him bleed the freer; ſuffer him to drink warm water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you open the Vein.</p>
               <p>If he bleed not freely, it is a ſign that he is purſie, fat, or the blood ſtagnated, then to oblige him thereto put your finger in his mouth, tickle him, and cauſe him to move his Jaws, thereby to preſs the vein to a more facil evacuation, and having bled ſufficiently, take part of the blood mingled with ſalt, and pour it down his throat, with a Drenching-horn, and with the other part bathe his body whilſt it is warm, which is excellent in a conſumption, moiſt cough, or weakneſs of the Limbs.</p>

               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:58037:86"/>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerve if the Horſe be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin, his blood produceth a white thick matter, but if Colerick, a wateriſh ſalt and thin matter, though in quantity ſmall. If Phlegmatick, great ſtore of watery gelly, as it were; but if Melanchly, dry Scabs only.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, obſerve as I have before hinted, never to bleed your Horſe but upon the days preſcribed, and not then for fanſie ſake, but in caſe of ſome diſtemper that requires it, or to prevent a ſickneſs imminent by reaſon of bad or boiling blood, which afflicts the Veins.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Obſerve in all Impoſthumes or ſwelling Sores, called Tumors, diligently to note the place where the grief began its increaſe, ſtate and dangerous conſequence, as likewiſe its declination and ending.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Take notice, that if in the beginning of every ſwelling Impoſthume, you cannot eradicate it, uſe Repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive medicines; if it be not too near the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals or ſome other principal part of the body; if it be, you muſt forbear the uſe of ſuch Medicines or applications, leſt thereby you indanger the Horſes life, but rather uſe ſoftening and ſuppling medicines, till ſuch time as the Impoſthume, Tumor or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be ripe, and then with a Lancet let out
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58037:86"/> the corruption, and by degrees dry it up with cleanſing and healing medicines.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, All ſoft or hard ſwellings ought to have different applications according to the part of the body where they happen, or the cauſe from which they proceed; as for hard ſwellings, they are for the moſt part corroſive, and the ſoft unleſs well regarded, of long continuance. Now to know whether a ſwelling has been of long ſtanding, eſpecially in the legs, preſs it with your finger, and ſuddainly taking it away, if you perceive the fleſh immediately to fill the dint, then the ſwelling is newly taken, but if it ſtand hollow, then is the ſwelling of a long ſtanding, proceeding from ſome old hurt, and will not be removed without difficulty.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If Sores matter moderately, then it denotes they cure a pace; but if the putrefaction increaſe more and more, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times denotes inward rottenneſs.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Obſerve that Cauterizing with hot Irons, always ſtraineth things inlarged, diſſolveth gatherings or hardneſs; dryeth up moſture, draweth to one place diſperſed humours, and helpeth old griefs, by cauſing them to ripen ſpeedily, and avoid the matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humour they contain; in cauterizing take notice alſo that you burn ſometimes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58037:87"/> under the ſore to divert the humour, and ſometimes above to defend and keep back the humour: as for burning, it is done two ways, the one called Actual, and the other Potential. The former being done with hot Irons, and the latter with hot Oyles, Waters, and other Cauſticks, and Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

To cure which, take theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. To clear and take away the bloodſhot, or ſetling of blood in the Eyes, taketh juice of Sowthiſtle, by ſome called our Ladys thiſtle, and ſpirit it into his eyes once or twice a day, for divers days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if your Horſe be dimſighted, or have a thin Film over his eyes, take the juice of Cabbage or Colewortſtalks, boyl it with a ſmall quantity of hony, and ſpirt it into his eyes, and in ſo doing ſix or ſeven times, it will conſume the Film and clear the ſight; nay, take away the Canker in the Eye, if it be not too far gone.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58037:96"/> the which is likewiſe exceeding good to clear the ſight, as likewiſe doth the juice of ordinary Centaury: if your Horſe be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Moon Eyes, put into them Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof or ground Ivy juice, and it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to a perfect ſight. If your Horſe be troubled with ſalt fiery humours or Rhumes in his Eyes, waſh them with the juice of Houſeleek, and by ſo doing often, it will allay the heat and drive back the Rhume; the juices of Germander and Eyebright, conſume the Pin and Web in the Eyes, and greatly reſtore the ſight.

               <p>OF Hoofs, there are divers kinds, ſome perfect, and others imperfect: The imperfect Hoof, is when any part is lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or if it be unſeemly, ſpreading broad,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58037:147"/> and being exceeding flat, that no ſhooe will ſit compleatly upon it, for ſuch Horſes for the moſt part are narrow heel'd, on which he for the moſt part treads, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf thereby unable for Travailing, ſubjecting him frequently to caſt his ſhooes, and ſubject to falſe quarters; and this is often cauſed by the Horſes being brought up in moiſt and Fenny ground. To ſhoo which, not being as yet grown to too flat, the Farrier with his paring Iron muſt take off as much of the Toe and ſides as it is poſſible, ſtill keeping it round, but let him not touch the quarter or the heel, unleſs it be to make the ſeat of the ſhoo plain, and let that be as lightly as may be, ſtill anointing the Hoofs with Hogs-greaſe and Oyl of Baies, and within a while they will become round thick and feaſable: The ſhoo wherewith this Hoof muſt be brought to perfection, muſt be made ſtrong, with a broad webb, and broad Spunges, pierced from the quarters to the hard Toe, but not to the Heel, the holes wider without than within, and the foot diligently pared as aforeſaid, from the Tallon nail towards the heel, ſuffer the ſhoo to ſtand a ſtraws breadth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Hoof; the better to ſave the Coffin, let your nails be made of good Iron, the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58037:148"/> heads ſquare, but not ſo broad above as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they may not only ſtand above the ſhooe, but fill the holes, putting five nails on the outſide, and four on the inſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this caſe the Horſe weareth more within than without.</p>

               <p>IF the Hoof be perfect, firſt pare the ſeat of the Shooe as even and plain as may be, that the ſhooe ſitting cloſe may bear no more on the one ſide than on the other, nor take more on the Toe than the Heel; for the Heels muſt be higher than the Toes, but by reaſon all the weight of the Horſes fore part preſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the quarters, and heels of the fore feet, thoſe parts muſt be moſt regarded, and as little of the Buttereſſes taken off as may be; for the heels are naturally weaker than the toes: but this is meant by the fore-feet only, for the paring of the hinder-feet is quite contrary, as will hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>For the moſt exact method of ſhooing the perfect Hoof, obſerve theſe following rules, <hi>viz.</hi> Let your ſhooe be of Spaniſh Iron, or other well tempered Iron, the

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58037:149"/> to rights; then with a Raſp pare the Hoof, till the edges appear.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The flat hoof is much of the nature of the imperfect hoof: in paring this hoof you muſt take away the toe, till you can make the ſhooe ſit compleat, as alſo the ſides, the heel and ball touch not, but let them remain as ſtrong as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: Then having a ſhooe with a broad Web, for the more it covers the weak ſole, the more commodious it is, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Middle part of the web that covers the Ball of the Foot to be much thicker than the other; where the piercings are, and ſo hollow that it touch no part of the Ball of the Foot, large enough in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, ſo that he may go eaſily, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it round the toe, to favour the heels, and faſtened on with five nails on a ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Broad Fruſhes are when the Fruſhes are broad, the heels weak and ſoft, that they may be in a manner bent together, which makes him tread ginger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or painfully on ſtony or hard ground: in paring this hoof you muſt be very cautious, paring only the toe and a little the ſeat of the ſhooe, leſt you lame your Horſe: The ſhooe muſt be ſtronger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the heel than the toe, and the Web in that part broadeſt: ſet on this ſhooe with
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58037:150"/> nine nails, and in all other reſpects uſe it as the perfect hoof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Narrow heels are frequently tender and of no long indurance, in which caſe you muſt pare the toe ſhort, making the ſeat of the ſhooe fair and plain, and open only, that there may be a little ſpace between the Fruſh and the heel: for the better it is, the leſs you take off the heel: The ſhooe for this purpoſe muſt be light, the Web broad, and the Sponges almoſt meet: let the piercing be all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the toe, ſparing the heel ſo much as you can, ſuffering it to be long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that way, and faſten it with eight nails. If the hoof be over hollow, yet firm, pare it round about the edges, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the ſeat of the ſhooe, to the intent the hollowneſs within may not be ſo deep, always keep it moiſt with ſtopping it, for fear of hoof-binding; and let the ſhooe be in all points the ſame with that directed for the perfect hoof. And thus much for the fore feet.</p>

Then having beaten the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en place with a Hazle wand, let it go, and thruſting in your Roweling needle, which muſt be ſeven or eight inches long, let it come out above the place grieved, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it Hair or Sarſnet to the thickneſs of a mans finger, annointed with butter or Hogs-lard, ſtir it about, and every day dreſs it with Lard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The which will cauſe the corruption, though contracted deep in the fleſh or in the joynts, to come away; but obſerve that you Rowel the ſame way the veins run, and not croſs, for fear of laming your Horſe.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>The Jockies device to cheat the Buyer, with a blind or lame Horſe.</head>
               <p>IF the Horſe be blind through age or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, or with exceſſive riding, and his ſight irrecoverably loſt, though no Pin, Web, Haw, Film, or the like be apparent, but the defect is in the very center of the Eye, by the defect of nerves, inſenſibly that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the ſpeculative ſight to the twinkles. Then the Jocky having dreſſed him up to the beſt advantage, keeps him two or three days at high feeding, and ſtill as he comes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58037:154"/> to dreſs ſtrikes, him over the face and eyes with his whip or wand, till the Horſe with the leaſt ſuddain noiſe, fearing the coming of the whip or ſwitch, toſſes up his head, and winks, as if he foreſaw it, which deceives the buyer, in ſuppoſing he does ſo. Another way the Jockey has in often blowing ground Pepper, Ginger, Salt or Allum into the Horſes eyes, which makes him always ſo fearful of being tormented in that nature, that when the Jockey has brought him to Market, and his eyes are queſtioned, he preſently ſwears they are perfect (being ſeldom without a Budget full of new minted Oaths) and thereupon tells the Buyer that with the leaſt motion of his hand the Horſe ſhall ſtart, mount his head, or ſhut his eyes; which proves ſo by this means, the Jockey has always in his pocket ſmall ſhot leſs than pins heads, Rapeſeed or the like, a few of which he unperceived of the Buyer, holds between his finger and thumb, and upon the motion of his hand fillips them into the Horſes face or eyes, who upon the leaſt feeling, ſuppoſing that he is about to be tormented, throws up his head, winks or ſtarts: nay, he ſo orders it by buffeting him with his hat often
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58037:154"/> when he has him by himſelf, that when he feels the wind thereof, he will ſtart: by which the unskilful Buyer frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf, whilſt the Jockey laughs in his ſleeve. Another trick he has by touching the Horſe on the knees, or under the belly, to make him mount his head, which he brings him to by former check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a rigid curb bridle, faſtned to thoſe places; if you ask him to ride the Horſe, unleſs it be in a plain field or even Road, he will tell you he would not have you put your ſelf to that trouble, but he'l call ſome poor boy or other, and give him a peny to do it, that ſo he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obſerve his going: then has he ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering up and down, or ſtanding aloof, an arch Rogue of his own, acquainted with all the infirmities of the Horſe, whom he calls, as if he had never before ſeen him, and he manages the Horſe to the ſatisfaction of the Jockey and Buyer: If there be any viſible obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſight, and the Jockey cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, then having blowed powder of Tartar into his Eye or Eyes, which will for five or ſix hours after cauſe him to wink, that the Blemiſh cannot be eaſily diſcerned, he chuſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58037:155"/> ſuch a Horſe to ſale in a gloomy day or by Candlelight. Theſe and many more Artifices he uſes, to put off a blind Horſe.</p>
               <p>If the Jockey has bought a lame or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe for little or nothing, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he deſigns him for the Dogs, and indeed he is ſo incurable, that he is fit for little elſe; then bringing him home, he alters him by trimming, makes a Blaze or Star, where there was none, putting him on falſe locks, or taking away Spots, Stars or Marks, ſo that ſometimes the firſt owner, not knowing him, has bought him again of the Jockey at a dear rate. The Horſe thus accoutered, he feeds high with Maſhes and the like, waſhing his limbs with the decoction or broth of Sheeps heads, Mallows and Smallage, bathing them with hot Oyles; if the lameneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from cold diſtempers, or if from hot or any caſualty, then with cooling oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments well heated and chafed, giving him a ſcowring or two, then pricking his ſides on the ſpurring places, he rubs in powder of Glaſs, decently covering it with the hair, then ſtops the Horſes feet with flax dipped in Pitch or Tarr, and paring them every day, brings them into good form and evenneſs, putting on exceeding heavy
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58037:155"/> ſhooes, that by being uſed to them he may be the more nimble when light ones are placed in their ſtead: thus having uſed him, if he be a Foundred Horſe he loggs him him with Lead, placing plates thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhooes, to ſupport his hoofs, and make him tread firm, but if ſubject to Aches, Sprains, Spavin, Ringbone, Scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or the like, waſhing his legs down, he binds them about with Liſts till he comes into the Market, and then in his Inn, or ſome Corner, taking them off, he ſets a light Lad upon him, having firſt rubbed hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Tuel with Cowitch or young nettles, and then has he divers to cheapen him, and ſeeming altogether ſtrangers to him, offer to ſtrike him Earneſt at a pretty round rate; which he in a great heat refuſes, wondering they will undervalue his Horſe and their own judgments: upon which they begin to handle him, and rubbing the place where the glaſs has fretted, cauſe him to winch and caper, then having well viewed him, they ſwear he is ſound, Wind and Limb, and that he may be worth the mony; but he is to buy for a friend, and muſt not exceed his order, though had he occaſion for one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, againſt the world he would have a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:58037:156"/> good one, and ſo goes away: This ſets divers unexperienced buyers agog, who no ſooner begin to handle the Horſe, but a fellow comes and whiſpers the Jockey in the ear, as ſuppoſed to come from him that laſt bid mony, with new offers, and then ſtrikes him Earneſt, yet he refuſes it: whereupon for fear the Horſe ſhould be bought up, whom the Standers by ſuppoſe to be of ſingular goodneſs, one or other bids money, which the Jock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey ſeems to ſlight, ſtanding at a great diſtance till he has ſcrewed up as high as he can, and perceives none elſe forward in bidding, then all on a ſuddain he claps up the bargain, ſwearing he is too cheap, yet he has no paſture or convenient ſtanding for him, or elſe he would not ſell him for half as much more. And thus is the ignorant Buyer cheated, perhaps with a Lame, Spavened, Foundred and infirm Horſe, buying Dogs meat inſtead of a ſerviceable Beaſt.</p>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58037:160"/> hundred Horſes which he has cured of all diſtempers and Sorrances, he undertakes to cure him for ſo much money, perhaps half a piece or more, which he performs by taking away the needle, ſilk or hair, and ſuppling the place with Oyl of Baies; though that he may ſeem to deſerve his money, he uſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlipſlops altogether uſeleſs and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>Another trick the Jockey has to make a Horſe in all parts appear as if he were dying, which is to thruſt down his throat a ball made with flower of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, and a mixture of ſix Grains of Opium, at what time he puts in as before, either to lend, ſell, ſwap, buy or cure: another way he has to make a Horſe Tremble, Sweat, Pant, Stair, and the like, whilſt the Farrier in vain uſes medicines to cure him, which he does by thruſting a Stone as big as a peny whiteloaf, dipped in Oyl of Spike into the Horſes Fundament: the former of theſe he antidotes with the juice of Rue, and Olive Oyl; and the latter he eaſes by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the ſtone, anointing his Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Hogs-lard, and whilſt he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and cures, he frequently ſends the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58037:161"/> Hoſtler for a pot of Ale, or about ſome ſuch frivolous errand, that he may not diſcover the knavery.</p>
               <p>If the Jockey has a Horſe with one or both eyes intirely out, he ſeeks for a Horſe newly dead; and taking forth his eyes, he ſteeps them a night in white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, which makes them plump and bright; then he forces them into the lids of the blind Horſe, glewing together the further corners to keep them in, and teaches the Horſe to ſtart, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have diſcovered them; having well accout ed him he brings him to Market in the Evening, or in a very gloomy day, and by that means cheats the ignorant buyer, ſuppoſing he has bought an excellent penyworth; tho' the next morning perhaps through the Horſes ſtraining he finds his falſe eyes in the Manger, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to the incantation of ſome Witch, Wizard, Incubus, or envious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>If a Horſe has loſt his Main, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unſeemly, the Jockey ſhaving it cloſe, takes the Main of a dead Horſe, skin and all, and having well dried or dreſſed it, ſews it ſo artificially to the live Horſes skin, that it muſt be a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58037:161"/> eye that diſcovers it, by reaſon the upper part being glewed makes it ſit compleat and faſt: the like meaſures he takes to ſet on falſe Ears, falſe Foretops, and falſe Tails; and ſome have gone ſo far that when a Horſe through age has loſt his Teeth, they have ſet him in artificial ones, as the Teeth of young dead Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo deceived the Buyer.</p>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58037:162"/> it to reſt there four days, then taking it out claps the skin cloſe, ſo that the hair growing again, becomes as white as milk.</p>
               <p>To make a Red Star, Blaze or Snip in a White-Horſe, he ſhaves away the hair, and anoints the skin with Oyl of Vitriol, Soot, and the juice of Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.

The Cow muſt not be too large nor too ſmall, rather long than ſhort, her Rump broad, of colour Black, with ſome changeable ſpots of White or Red, her Wind-pipe large, her Womb the like, her forehead flat and broad, her Eyes large and Black, her Horns long, but ſmooth, and for the moſt part black, great Mouth, thin Cheeks, wide Noſtrils, large Dew-laps, long and thick-neck, broad Shoulders long Tail, ſmooth and even Claws, long Teats, and broad Breaſt: and in making theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in your choice, you will ſeldom or never miſs of a good breed, if you order them accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> put not your Heifer to the Bull, till ſhe be three years old, and ſuffer her not to bear Calves for ſtore after twelve. The beſt time to put her to the Bull is in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June;</hi> and to know when ſhe is deſirous of him, obſerve if the Claws of her feet be ſwollen, the which if they be, then is it a ſign of Luſt in her, and that ſhe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58037:164"/> is deſirous to be covered, or by her continual lowing, the ſame may be known; and that ſhe may the ſooner conceive, keep her with ſpare diet, two or three days before you lead her to the Bull, and the leaner the better, though the Bull at the ſame time muſt be in good Caſe; if ſhe refuſe to take the Bull, or that the Bull be backward, burn Harts-Tail under their noſes, or rub the Cows Reception place with Nettleſeeds, or ground Ginger, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with a Sponge, with which Sponge rub the Bulls noſe, and by ſo doing you will provoke them to deſire: when the Cow has ſo often received the Bull as you think convenient, put her into a warm houſe for a weeks ſpace, not milking her in that time, unleſs her Udders ſtretch, then put her into an incloſed field, where ſhe cannot leap out, nor run through Buſhes, ſuffering her often to drink clear water, and in ſo ordering her at ten months end ſhe will bring you a luſty Calf or two, if no caſualty prevent it.</p>
            <p>When your Cow has Calved, you muſt give her a comfortable doſe, <hi>viz.</hi> half a pint of Malmſey, four new laid
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58037:164"/> Eggs, and a pint of Ale mixed together, ſuffering the Calf to lie by her in freſh and warm ſtraw: and as ſoon as you find he has recovered any ſtrength, put him to the Teat, at what time if you perceive him bubble and rather mumble the Teat than ſuck, or if it be at any time after, look under his tongue, and if you there perceive a white fleſhy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance growing over the Tongue, cut it away with a ſharp pair of Sciſſars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding the Tongue, waſhing it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with Water, Salt and the juice of Garlick, and when the Calf begins to grow up, it you perceive he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Lice, or afflicted with Scabs, keep him in freſh ſtraw, and waſh him with urine, wherein Butter and Colewort-ſtalks have been boiled.</p>
            <p>In gelding your Calf, that he may ſo be an Ox, the beſt time is at a year and half Old, when the Moon is in the Wane, obſerving that the ſign at that time, be not in <hi>Libra, Scorpio,</hi> nor <hi>Sagittarius.</hi> The manner of gelding muſt be thus, throw him on ſoft Straw, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good help to hold him, that he hurt not himſelf with ſtrugling, then taking one Cod between your fingers, ſlit it ſo
